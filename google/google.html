                ['"From the Wires Today, the iBIO Institute EDUCATE Center kicked off its third annual STEMgirls Summer Camp hosted at Andrew Cooke Magnet Elementary School in Waukegan. This week-long learning experience provides 125 young girls (grades 3-8) with opportunities to learn more about careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through challenging and fun hands-on activities. Campers will take part in a wide range of activities throughout the week, using engineering and design principles to solve different challenges: Monday, June 18: “The Sounds of Music” – Campers will learn about sound engineering by building and tuning their own percussion, wind and string instruments. Tuesday, June 19: “Getting a Grip” – Campers will create their own prosthetic arm while learning about biomechanical engineering, joint structure and function. Wednesday, June 20: “Building Things That Go” – Campers will create propeller launchers, rubber band cars, coffee cup copters and tethered airplanes. During the second half of the day, the girls build a motorized car. Thursday, June 21: Field Trip Day – Elementary school-aged campers will conduct experiments with the staff at Racine Zoo, and middle school-aged campers will get a tour of R&D facilities at Medline Industries Inc. while learning about mechanical testing. Friday, June 22: Parent Panel – Parents of campers will attend a panel discussion providing guidance on STEM education and career pathways for their daughters, and will then join their campers for a day of family activities. Campers hail primarily from communities where access to STEM programing is limited. STEMgirls is supported by some of Illinois’ leading life sciences companies including Abbott, AbbVie, the Astellas USA Foundation, Horizon Pharma and the VWR Foundation. “This incredible week of learning and development for young girls interested in STEM wouldn’t be possible without the generous support from our donors,” said Ann Vogel, senior vice president of the iBIO Institute EDUCATE Center. “Their recognition of the growing need for STEM education early-on provides these young girls with an enriching experience that leads to opportunities they otherwise might not have access to.” At the end of the week, parents of the STEMgirls campers can attend a panel discussion featuring speakers from Abbott and the Astellas USA Foundation to learn more about how they can support their daughters interest in STEM and connect them to various community support organizations. “The STEMgirls Camp is an amazing opportunity for girls in our district. They are exposed to wonderful new projects and experiences through this program,” said Stephanie Jensen, principal of Andrew Cooke Magnet Elementary School. “The hands-on approach makes the week fun and exciting for the girls.” About iBIO Institute The mission of the iBIO Institute, established in 2003 by the Illinois Biotechnology Innovation Organization (iBIO), is to orchestrate business leadership in delivery of world-class educational programs and job-creating new technology ventures.

For the first time in the U.S., people will see a major reduction in their prescription costs, Trump said Wednesday as he prepared to sign the Right to Try Act, passed last week by the House. (See BioWorld , May 23, 2018.) After drug prices took center stage in the 2016 presidential campaign, some biopharma companies scaled back their price increases to single-digit percentages, but major cuts in list prices are unheard of outside of competitive pressure. For instance, when Mylan NV faced congressional wrath over its list price increase for Epipen (epinephrine) auto-injectors, it chose to offer an authorized generic rather than lower the list price. (See BioWorld Today , Aug. 31, 2016.) Responding to public pressure, U.S. lawmakers from both parties have floated ideas about how to force price cuts, and the HELP Committee has held three hearings on the topic in the past year. The committee will hold its fourth hearing June 12 – about the time of Trumps promised price cut announcement. At the upcoming hearing, the committee will quiz Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar about the blueprint the president unveiled earlier this month to reduce drug prices. (See BioWorld , May 15, 2018.) Meanwhile, the ideas are still flowing, as Americans continue to identify the cost of health care as their top concern. Given that they pay nearly twice as much for health care as people in other developed countries, they want answers – and a fix. In search of a fix ""Americans know the status quo is unacceptable. They want solutions,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said Tuesday as he called on Congress to put politics aside and ""challenge those who are protecting a broken system that imposes higher costs on families without delivering better value."" A member of the HELP Committee and a doctor, Cassidy released a white paper chock full of ideas to fix the system – from drug prices to hospital and insurance costs. If drug companies, and the health care system as a whole, dont do something about pricing, some of the solutions pushed by Cassidy and other lawmakers may become reality. When it comes to drug prices, Cassidys Ideas to make health care affordable again said any set of solutions must: • empower patients through transparency; • realign incentives toward innovation and better outcomes and away from ""me-too"" drugs; • blunt tools of regulatory arbitrage and gaming the system; • bring what the U.S pays for innovative drugs in line with what other countries pay. To bring transparency to drug pricing, Cassidy demanded an end to gag clauses imposed by pharmacy benefit managers on pharmacies. In keeping with the presidents blueprint, the federal government is already moving in that direction, with Medicare sending out letters a few weeks ago to all Part D plan sponsors saying that gag clauses are unacceptable. However, such clauses still may be permissible in private-sector plans. Gag clauses arent the only transparency problem at the pharmacy, Cassidy said. He proposed giving patients a ""point of sale rebate,"" which is the same price the insurance company pays for a drug, instead of the list price the drug companies have said no one pays. Citing a ""secret shoppers"" call for the cash price of a months supply of five commonly used drugs at an online pharmacy, 25 independent pharmacies and the major national chain pharmacies, Cassidy said the cost for the same five drugs at the various pharmacies ranged from $69 to $1,351. To realign incentives toward innovation and better outcomes, Cassidy advised expediting reviews for innovative, high priority drugs and providing longer protection for truly innovative cures as opposed to me-too drugs or those that treat a nuisance rather than a deadly or disabling condition. As an example of exorbitant spending on me-too products, he pointed to Horizon Pharma USA Inc. s Duexis , a combination of the generic, over-the-counter (OTC) drugs ibuprofen (Motrin) and famotidine (Pepcid) that costs 130 time more than what a patient would pay for the two OTC drugs. ""Unsuspecting and unknowing patients, directly or indirectly through higher insurance premiums, pay $2,600 a month for $20 worth of generic OTC medicine,"" Cassidy said. The senator suggested contracting with a third party to ensure a new drug is truly innovative. Cassidys third recommendation – stopping drug companies from gaming the system – is something the Trump administration is addressing. As a first step toward ending regulatory arbitrage, the FDA this month publicly named drug companies that refused to provide samples of their products to would-be generic competitors. (See BioWorld , May 18, 2018.) Cassidy said other steps that could be taken include ""aggressively preventing companies from limiting generic competition through pay to delay or by buying competing product lines and shutting them down."" To keep sponsors of single-source, off-patent drugs from taking advantage of their monopolies by jacking up prices, Cassidy suggested allowing patients to buy those drugs on the international market – provided that the drug purchased is manufactured at a facility thats certified by the FDA or an equivalent regulator such as the EMA and thats producing an approved drug distributed in compliance with guidelines and logistics as safe and secure as those mandated in the U.S. Such a proposal addresses the safety concerns raised by calls for reimportation, Cassidy said, while tackling high drug costs through market forces. Comparable prices To ensure that Americans pay comparable prices to other countries, Cassidy said U.S. prices for a new drug should be pegged to a market-basket of what other larger, advanced economies pay. Alternative payment models, such as value- or outcomes-based purchasing, could be developed for novel drugs like gene therapies and drugs first introduced in the U.S. Cassidy also proposed some pricing steps for Medicare and other government programs. If a class has multiple drugs, Medicare shouldnt pay more than the lowest-priced drug in the class, he said, and the classes shouldnt be defined so narrowly that similarly acting drugs are in different classes. While the senators white paper didnt address the cost and time involved in R&D that industry often cites in justifying high drug prices, the president Wednesday noted the advances his administration is making to streamline that process, reducing both the cost and the time without sacrificing safety. In the past, industry claimed that bringing a new drug to market in the U.S. typically took an average of 15 years. At Trumps prompting Wednesday at the Right to Try signing, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that while some drugs may still take more than 10 years, the average length for developing a drug today in the U.S. is five to seven years.""/PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- More than 800 rare disease patients and advocates from around the globe will gather at Hotel Irvine in Irvine, California on October 3-4, 2018 for Global Genes® 7th Annual RARE Patient Advocacy Summit.

According to the results, presented today as part of a panel discussion: ""Beyond Adult Patients, Untapped Advisors in Clinical Development"" at the DIA meeting, 91% of caregivers report being ""very involved"" in medical choices and/or treatment decisions, participating in an average of 17 doctor visits per year and accompanying their care recipient to see an average of six different healthcare providers in the past two years. ""Much is already understood about the challenges and burdens of caregivers,"" said Ann Moravick, President of Rx4good, ""but until now, little was known about the extent of their role as medical decision-makers, including the precipitating factors in taking on the role of caregiver, their information-seeking priorities and habits or their engagement with healthcare practitioners. This research shows that caregivers are medical understudies, thrust into their role unprepared while learning continuously so they can be a true partner with their care recipient and health professionals."" ""Sometimes we see the word informal to describe the family caregiver, but as this research shows, theres nothing informal about the type of care unpaid family members and friends can provide,"" said C. Grace Whiting, J.D., President and CEO of the National Alliance for Caregiving. ""Family caregivers are truly partners in care and should be integrated into models of care delivery. Shared decision-making should include not just the patient, but the family decision-makers as well."" Among the researchs key findings: Forty-three percent of caregivers stepped into their role as a result of a medical emergency, 24% as a result of a new diagnosis and 20% as their care recipients condition progressed. As a result, most are unprepared for the role and lack confidence in the beginning on how to care for a loved one with a medical condition. The caregiver/healthcare provider relationship is strong and based on trust. Eighty-eight percent of caregivers said doctors listen carefully to what they have to say, 87% say doctors respect their assessment of their care recipient and 85% say doctors treat them as a partner in care decisions. Caregivers who are more confident in their role have an even better relationship with their care recipients physician – speaking to the need for helping caregivers with information and support as they take on the role. Top priorities of caregivers include: maintaining or improving quality of life of their loved one (68%), keeping their loved one safe from injury from falls, accidents or other mishaps (49%) and extending the life and health of their care recipient (41%). In contrast, caregiver stresses and quality of life take on a much less important role in their decision-making, illustrating how many caregivers consider their own needs secondary to those of their care recipient. Confidence and involvement of caregivers grows over time. Twenty-eight percent felt they had the information they needed to make medical decisions or treatment choice at the onset, 89% reported actively seeking information when first taking on their caregiver role, 40% considered themselves expert on the medical condition, medications and treatment options at first and 59% reported an increasing role in medical decisions over the past year. Caregivers are information-seeking. Seventy-nine percent said they frequently searched for information about the medical condition, medications and treatment options of their care recipient. And, regardless of their confidence, caregivers keep seeking information throughout their journey with the patient. Sources most relied on for information include: loved ones doctor(s) or other health professionals (76%), health information websites, such as WebMD (51%), medical journal or medical literature (39%) and friends of family members (37%). Topics researched as helpful for making future care decisions include, new treatment options and medications (69%), support programs for caregivers like themselves (63%) and alternative treatment options (56%). Clinical trials and new treatments are of interest, but little understood. Half (50%) seek information about clinical trials and new treatment options, yet only 20% consider themselves expert in these areas – pointing to the need for more information and education of caregivers about clinical trials ""These findings show the need to support caregivers in their significant role as medical decision-makers,"" said Moravick. ""By acknowledging their influence as critical allies with healthcare professionals, providing them with education and resources throughout their journey, particularly at the onset when the need is greatest, and equipping them with tools to build confidence and reduce stress, we will help ease their burden and benefit those they love and care for.""

All Rights Reserved.""SOURCE Rx4good Vast majority of caregivers involved in doctor-patient interaction, researching treatment options and medical information, serving as a general ""point person"" in care BOSTON According to the results, presented today as part of a panel discussion: ""Beyond Adult Patients, Untapped Advisors in Clinical Development"" at the DIA meeting, 91% of caregivers report being ""very involved"" in medical choices and/or treatment decisions, participating in an average of 17 doctor visits per year and accompanying their care recipient to see an average of six different healthcare providers in the past two years. ""Much is already understood about the challenges and burdens of caregivers,"" said Ann Moravick ""Sometimes we see the word informal to describe the family caregiver, but as this research shows, theres nothing informal about the type of care unpaid family members and friends can provide,"" said C. Grace Whiting Among the researchs key findings: Forty-three percent of caregivers stepped into their role as a result of a medical emergency, 24% as a result of a new diagnosis and 20% as their care recipients condition progressed. As a result, most are unprepared for the role and lack confidence in the beginning on how to care for a loved one with a medical condition.The caregiver/healthcare provider relationship is strong and based on trust. Eighty-eight percent of caregivers said doctors listen carefully to what they have to say, 87% say doctors respect their assessment of their care recipient and 85% say doctors treat them as a partner in care decisions. Caregivers who are more confident in their role have an even better relationship with their care recipients physician – speaking to the need for helping caregivers with information and support as they take on the role.Top priorities of caregivers include: maintaining or improving quality of life of their loved one (68%), keeping their loved one safe from injury from falls, accidents or other mishaps (49%) and extending the life and health of their care recipient (41%). In contrast, caregiver stresses and quality of life take on a much less important role in their decision-making, illustrating how many caregivers consider their own needs secondary to those of their care recipient.Confidence and involvement of caregivers grows over time. Twenty-eight percent felt they had the information they needed to make medical decisions or treatment choice at the onset, 89% reported actively seeking information when first taking on their caregiver role, 40% considered themselves expert on the medical condition, medications and treatment options at first and 59% reported an increasing role in medical decisions over the past year.Caregivers are information-seeking. Seventy-nine percent said they frequently searched for information about the medical condition, medications and treatment options of their care recipient. And, regardless of their confidence, caregivers keep seeking information throughout their journey with the patient. Sources most relied on for information include: loved ones doctor(s) or other health professionals (76%), health information websites, such as WebMD (51%), medical journal or medical literature (39%) and friends of family members (37%). Topics researched as helpful for making future care decisions include, new treatment options and medications (69%), support programs for caregivers like themselves (63%) and alternative treatment options (56%). Clinical trials and new treatments are of interest, but little understood. Half (50%) seek information about clinical trials and new treatment options, yet only 20% consider themselves expert in these areas – pointing to the need for more information and education of caregivers about clinical trials ""These findings show the need to support caregivers in their significant role as medical decision-makers,"" said Moravick. ""By acknowledging their influence as critical allies with healthcare professionals, providing them with education and resources throughout their journey, particularly at the onset when the need is greatest, and equipping them with tools to build confidence and reduce stress, we will help ease their burden and benefit those they love and care for.""

All Rights Reserved.""SOURCE Lupus Research Alliance NEW YORK Managing lupus is challenging because no two cases are alike and symptoms vary widely. While better treatments and medical care have improved life expectancy, lupus is still not adequately controlled in many people, and the disease often progresses. Also, many current therapies carry risks of debilitating side effects. Inaugural LuCIN Clinical Studies The Lupus Research Alliance has forged several strategic partnerships with the pharmaceutical/biotech industry to launch its first portfolio of clinical studies within LuCIN. The non-profit organization is collaborating with Celgene Corporation to further study CC-220, an oral drug being developed to treat systemic lupus erythematosus. Based on results of earlier studies, as well as the unmet medical need for safe and effective oral therapies, Celgene will further evaluate this drug candidate within LuCIN in a global multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical study. In partnership with Pfizer Inc., a non-interventional clinical study entitled VAlidation in LUpus of an Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes Tool (VALUE) has been initiated within LuCIN to test a custom smartphone app enabling lupus patients to report on their health-related quality of life and fatigue and other symptoms in real time rather than completing surveys during visits to physicians offices. The app was designed with input from people with lupus. Pfizer Inc., the Lupus Research Alliance, AMPEL BioSolutions and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. jointly developed the new mobile app, using the Apple ResearchKit platform and building on existing research tools that have been validated in lupus. In conjunction with Horizon Pharma, the clinical study entitled Rayos Inhibits Fatigue in Lupus Erythematosus (RIFLE) will test the effect of RAYOS® on severe fatigue and morning stiffness often experienced by people with lupus. RAYOS is the first low-dose, delayed-release form of the steroid prednisone, a widely prescribed anti-inflammatory drug. RIFLE also tests a customized mobile app to measure fatigue, health-related quality of life, disease activity and morning stiffness throughout the trial. RIFLE is a collaboration between the Lupus Research Alliance, AMPEL BioSolutions, Carematix, Verizon and Samsung. Another study, entitled Dynamic Imaging to Assess Variation in Lupus Nephritis (DIVINE), has the potential to replace standard invasive surgical biopsy with sophisticated MRI technology to assess lupus nephritis and better tailor treatment decisions based on disease activity. This study is a collaboration between the Lupus Research Alliance, AMPEL BioSolutions and ImageAnalysis. The Lupus Research Alliance, in partnership with Merck/EMD Serono is collaborating on a phase II clinical study to evaluate M2951, a novel inhibitor of Brutons Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) in Lupus, within the Lupus Research Alliance Lupus Clinical Investigators Network (LuCIN). Although BTK inhibitors are used as a therapy to treat individuals with blood cancer disorders, the mechanism of action of BTK suggests a use for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases, including Lupus. Up to 20 LuCIN centers geographically disbursed throughout North America ""The Lupus Research Alliance is excited and proud to take the lead in conducting clinical trials that will accelerate the process of developing new treatments for lupus, and improve tools to diagnose and monitor the disease,"" said Albert Roy Click here for more information about LuCIN and clinical trials. About Lupus Lupus is a chronic, complex autoimmune disease that affects millions of people worldwide. More than 90% of lupus sufferers are women, mostly young women between the ages of 15 to 44. Women of color are especially at risk. In lupus, the immune system, which is designed to protect against infection, creates antibodies that attack the bodys own tissues and organs -- the kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, blood, skin, and joints. About the Lupus Research Alliance The Lupus Research Alliance leads the quest to free the world from lupus through the power of science. The 501 (c)(3) is the only international private funder devoted to lupus research. The organization propels lupus research in new directions to pursue better treatments while driving to a cure. Because the Lupus Research Alliance Board of Directors funds all administrative and fundraising costs, 100% of all donations goes to support lupus research programs. And with pivotal discoveries, the Lupus Research Alliance is breaking through.

To keep employees happy, companies in this field must adapt, be flexible, and stay true to their values. Great benefits and perks also don’t hurt. To compile this list, Fortune partner Great Place to Work interviewed thousands of staffers about their jobs. Below, the top companies in both industries that get the highest marks for work/life balance, and whose employees actually love coming to work. Read more about how companies create cultures that land them on this list. Top Heath Care Companies to Work For 1. Texas Health Resources Courtesy of Texas Health Resources Headquarters: Arlington, Texas Number of U.S. employees: 21,686 Company type: Non-Profit Employees say: “I appreciate that everyone at the table is encouraged to speak up and offer a perspective. I like that our leaders subscribe to a ‘best idea wins’ mentality rather than relying only on leaders for input and guidance.” “The teamwork on my unit and a few others that I have experience with are unmatched. I have worked here for a year and still love coming to work because I feel supported and love my coworkers. You can’t find that everywhere. I’m also a student and I have felt welcomed with many encouraging my education through words of affirmation and learning opportunities in the clinical setting. I couldn’t imagine working anywhere else.” 2. Encompass Home Health And Hospice Headquarters: Dallas, Texas Number of U.S. employees: 8,453 Company type: Private Employees say: “What makes this a great place to work for me is feeling like management actually cares about me as a person. I have been made to feel like part of a team. Everyone does their share and helps each other when necessary.” “I am very new here, just over 2 months. From day one there has been an abundance of help, from the people in the office that I work with daily to preceptors who have been sent in to help the new hires. I can honestly say no other company I have ever worked for has gone the extra mile like Encompass has. I look forward to a very long and rewarding career here.” 3. Southern Ohio Medical Center Courtesy of Southern Ohio Medical Center Headquarters: Portsmouth, Ohio Number of U.S. employees: 2,586 Company type: Non-Profit Employees say: “I have always been encouraged to take steps to improve myself and to grow within the organization. I have been offered assistance to obtain a higher level of education and support in doing so.” “SOMC is a great place to work, mainly because of the attitudes of everyone here. If you pass someone in the hallway, they will smile or say hi. Everyone is usually willing to help a customer find their way, or help in any way possible. I feel like most everyone who works here strives to provide excellent care. When you care about your patients and feel like you have provided them excellent service, it gives purpose to your work and really helps you have a great attitude about having to come to work here every day. I personally feel that way myself, and you can look around at other employees and its obvious many others here feel the same way that I do.” 4. Caring Nurses Headquarters: Las Vegas, Nevada Number of U.S. employees: 103 Company type: Private Employees say: “Caring goes beyond a name. I have seen management pay to assist patients with medications, to clean their homes, and buy food for them. We started a food pantry so any of our field staff is welcome to come take food to our patients.” “I’ve worked for multiple home health agencies but Caring Nurses is my favorite. I love that we have the stock program and get statements every year on how well the company is doing. It makes you feel like you are on the winning team. I’ve seen the owners do a lot of pro-bono stuff for patients who don’t have money for meds or food and it’s heartwarming to work for people who care about more than just profit.” 5. Scripps Health Headquarters: San Diego, California Number of U.S. employees: 14,496 Company type: Non-Profit Employees say: “Our CEO is approachable and listens to questions from all employees. We are kept informed regarding changes in our industry. The management approach is proactive rather than reactive to any changes that the organization needs to make.” “Scripps does a wonderful job of selecting talent that mirrors the organization’s mission. This makes it easier to work with your fellow colleagues because they go beyond their job description to ensure the best result for the patient, program, or overall outcome for the organization. There is a sense of pride the employees have that stems from the synergy from one another which makes you automatically feel a part of the Scripps family. Chris Van Gorder is an excellent leader as he is very inclusive and egalitarian in his leadership which makes everyone feel special regardless of their role. You automatically sense that he would roll up his sleeves and get dirty just to get the job done. He also believes in leadership rounding which is something I wish more of the C-level executives would emulate as that further makes employees feel valued.” 6.

The manage..."-- Results reflect the undermanaged burden of uncontrolled gout --AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands, June 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Results from a new study presented in an oral presentation at the Annual European Congress of Rheumatology (EULAR 2018) show a dramatic 27 percent increase in emergency department (ED) visits between 2006 and 2014 for people living with gout in the United States. Horizon Pharma provided research support and funding for this study.""The dramatic increase in ED visits in the United States for patients with a primary diagnosis of gout over the past nine years reflects a sizeable and growing population of patients with gout whose symptoms are not controlled and not well managed,” said Gurkirpal Singh, M.D., lead study investigator and adjunct clinical professor of medicine at Stanford University. ""Often the treatment of gout focuses on alleviating the symptoms of painful gout flares. However, when escalating symptoms reach the threshold of an ED visit, this suggests that the underlying accumulation of uric acid may not have been adequately addressed.”Gout is a chronic, progressive inflammatory form of arthritis that is caused by excess uric acid in the body and needs to be managed aggressively.^i If uric acid levels in the blood remain elevated, thin rod-like crystals can form and deposit in the joints, which can lead to severe pain, tenderness, stiffness, swelling and joint damage. In addition to the joint damage, urate crystals can also deposit in other organs of the body,^ii and if left unmanaged, gout can lead to significant tissue damage.^iiiThe study Emergency Department Visits for Gout: A Dramatic Increase in the Past Decade (abstract OP0185), evaluated data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample (NEDS). Dr. Singh and colleagues studied all ED visits with a primary diagnosis of gout from 2006 to 2014 and calculated the prevalence of gout in different age groups using population data from the U.S. Census Bureau. NEDS, which yields national estimates of hospital-based ED visits, is the largest all-payer ED database in the United States, containing information from 31 million ED visits at 945 hospitals in 34 states. The study demonstrated that the total number of ED visits per year among patients with a primary diagnosis of acute gout increased 26.8 percent between 2006 and 2014 – from 168,580 to 213,780.Additional results showed that, over the nine-year period:· 1.7 million people visited EDs with a primary diagnosis of acute gout. · The prevalence of ED visits with a primary diagnosis of gout increased from 56.5/100,000 population in 2006 to 67/100,000 in 2""Patients as Partners is co-produced with patients, industry, academia, government and nonprofit organizations to establish a well-rounded program that addresses the needs of all stakeholders seeking to implement and advance patient involvement across the entire clinical development continuum.

For the original version on PRWeb visit: http://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/02/prweb15209177.htm""Many top drug manufacturers in the US began the year by raising prices for dozens of staple as well as blockbuster medicines. Yet the hikes are within the 10 percent bracket, following several public outcries over price gouging. Medication used to treat Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and high blood pressure – illnesses often associated with the elderly and the poor – are among the drugs identified for price hikes. The price increases, while still substantial, are more moderate because of the beating drugmakers took following several price hike scandals. Such as the one perpetrated by hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli in August 2015, when he acquired the rights to Daraprim, a drug used to treat HIV, and overnight increased the price from $13.50 to $750 per pill. The move prompted public outrage, especially from leading medical associations and three presidential candidates, including Donald Trump. The furor caused Shkreli to be referred to as “the most hated man in America” and “Pharma Bro.” He was later subpoenaed to appear before a Congressional hearing. A February 2017 survey of 3,000 brand name prescription drugs found that more than 60 had doubled in price between December 2014 and January 2016, while the cost of 20 drugs had gone up fourfold. Responding to the fierce criticism, specialty pharmaceuticals, Allergan, Teva, Collectis, Insys, Synergy and Supernus engaged in a self regulation process, and all prices raised, effective January 1, were under 10 percent for more than 30 drugs, according to Reuters. Allergan changed stickers on 18 medications, all by 9.5 percent, including Namenda XR which treats Alzheimer’s disease, Linzess, which targets irritable bowel syndrome and Bystolic, a high blood pressure drug. “The price increases are consistent with Allergan’s Social Contract with Patients, the average list price increase is consistent with our single-digit commitment, and this will be the only price increase on these brands in 2018, again, consistent with out commitment,” Allergan spokesperson told FiercePharma . Allergan’s “social contract” was introduced in 2016 during an intense pricing firestorm that year. Allergan CEO Brent Saunders said the industry should police itself on pricing or risk regulatory reform. Teva hiked prices on seven drugs, with increases of 2.3 percent to 9.4 percent on the respiratory drug ProAirRespiclick and Parkinson’s therapy Azilect. The increases coincide with cost cutting measures as well as laying off thousands of employees. Horizon Pharma, which was criticized for past hikes, kept its four price increases to 9.9 percent. Drug price increases are coming under more scrutiny from states. California Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation in October requiring drug manufacturers to give 60-day notice if prices are raised more than 16 percent over a two-year period. According to the World Health Organization , the global drug industry generates $300 billion a year with a whopping profit margin of about 30 percent.""By Michael Erman NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Drugmakers opened the new year by raising U.S. prices on dozens of medicines, but early data showed the increases generally remained within a 10 percent self-imposed limit in response to a backlash from consumers and politicians. Soaring U.S. prices for both branded and generic drugs have sparked public outrage and government investigations over the past few years. ""Drug price increases are somewhat more constrained in 2017 and 2018 than they have been previously,"" Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. Allergan Inc raised prices on 18 different drugs, including dry eye treatment Restasis and irritable bowel syndrome drug Linzess, by 9.5 percent, according to a research note released by Jefferies on Tuesday. Jefferies cited data collected by Medi-Span Price Rx and refers to list price increases, before potentially significant discounts and rebates that drugmakers provide to win preferred coverage by insurers. Medi-Span did not respond to requests to confirm the data. Allergans chief executive, Brent Saunders, in late 2016 pledged to keep price increases below 10 percent as part of what he called the companys ""Social Contract with Patients."" Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur said the increases will be the only ones taken on those brands in 2018, adding that discounts to various payers should bring the actual increases to consumers down to the low single digits. Other drugmakers raising prices include Amgen Inc, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc and Horizon Pharma, according to Jefferies and Cowen. Amgen raised the price on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drug Enbrel by 9.7 percent and Teva increased prices on its ProAir HFA and ProAir RespiClick asthma inhalers by 6 and 3 percent, respectively. Drug price increases are coming under more scrutiny from states. California Governor Jerry Brown in October signed legislation requiring drug manufacturers to give 60-day notice if prices are raised more than 16 percent over a two-year period. Shares of Allergan rose 4.1 percent on Tuesday, while Teva and Horizon Pharma shares were up 0.8 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.

""Much is already understood about the challenges and burdens of caregivers,"" said Ann Moravick ""Sometimes we see the word informal to describe the family caregiver, but as this research shows, theres nothing informal about the type of care unpaid family members and friends can provide,"" said C. Grace Whiting Among the researchs key findings: Forty-three percent of caregivers stepped into their role as a result of a medical emergency, 24% as a result of a new diagnosis and 20% as their care recipients condition progressed. As a result, most are unprepared for the role and lack confidence in the beginning on how to care for a loved one with a medical condition.The caregiver/healthcare provider relationship is strong and based on trust. Eighty-eight percent of caregivers said doctors listen carefully to what they have to say, 87% say doctors respect their assessment of their care recipient and 85% say doctors treat them as a partner in care decisions. Caregivers who are more confident in their role have an even better relationship with their care recipients physician – speaking to the need for helping caregivers with information and support as they take on the role.Top priorities of caregivers include: maintaining or improving quality of life of their loved one (68%), keeping their loved one safe from injury from falls, accidents or other mishaps (49%) and extending the life and health of their care recipient (41%). In contrast, caregiver stresses and quality of life take on a much less important role in their decision-making, illustrating how many caregivers consider their own needs secondary to those of their care recipient.Confidence and involvement of caregivers grows over time. Twenty-eight percent felt they had the information they needed to make medical decisions or treatment choice at the onset, 89% reported actively seeking information when first taking on their caregiver role, 40% considered themselves expert on the medical condition, medications and treatment options at first and 59% reported an increasing role in medical decisions over the past year.Caregivers are information-seeking. Seventy-nine percent said they frequently searched for information about the medical condition, medications and treatment options of their care recipient. And, regardless of their confidence, caregivers keep seeking information throughout their journey with the patient. Sources most relied on for information include: loved ones doctor(s) or other health professionals (76%), health information websites, such as WebMD (51%), medical journal or medical literature (39%) and friends of family members (37%). Topics researched as helpful for making future care decisions include, new treatment options and medications (69%), support programs for caregivers like themselves (63%) and alternative treatment options (56%). Clinical trials and new treatments are of interest, but little understood. Half (50%) seek information about clinical trials and new treatment options, yet only 20% consider themselves expert in these areas – pointing to the need for more information and education of caregivers about clinical trials ""These findings show the need to support caregivers in their significant role as medical decision-makers,"" said Moravick. ""By acknowledging their influence as critical allies with healthcare professionals, providing them with education and resources throughout their journey, particularly at the onset when the need is greatest, and equipping them with tools to build confidence and reduce stress, we will help ease their burden and benefit those they love and care for.""

All Rights Reserved.""SOURCE Lupus Research Alliance NEW YORK Managing lupus is challenging because no two cases are alike and symptoms vary widely. While better treatments and medical care have improved life expectancy, lupus is still not adequately controlled in many people, and the disease often progresses. Also, many current therapies carry risks of debilitating side effects. Inaugural LuCIN Clinical Studies The Lupus Research Alliance has forged several strategic partnerships with the pharmaceutical/biotech industry to launch its first portfolio of clinical studies within LuCIN. The non-profit organization is collaborating with Celgene Corporation to further study CC-220, an oral drug being developed to treat systemic lupus erythematosus. Based on results of earlier studies, as well as the unmet medical need for safe and effective oral therapies, Celgene will further evaluate this drug candidate within LuCIN in a global multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical study. In partnership with Pfizer Inc., a non-interventional clinical study entitled VAlidation in LUpus of an Electronic Patient Reported Outcomes Tool (VALUE) has been initiated within LuCIN to test a custom smartphone app enabling lupus patients to report on their health-related quality of life and fatigue and other symptoms in real time rather than completing surveys during visits to physicians offices. The app was designed with input from people with lupus. Pfizer Inc., the Lupus Research Alliance, AMPEL BioSolutions and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. jointly developed the new mobile app, using the Apple ResearchKit platform and building on existing research tools that have been validated in lupus. In conjunction with Horizon Pharma, the clinical study entitled Rayos Inhibits Fatigue in Lupus Erythematosus (RIFLE) will test the effect of RAYOS® on severe fatigue and morning stiffness often experienced by people with lupus. RAYOS is the first low-dose, delayed-release form of the steroid prednisone, a widely prescribed anti-inflammatory drug. RIFLE also tests a customized mobile app to measure fatigue, health-related quality of life, disease activity and morning stiffness throughout the trial. RIFLE is a collaboration between the Lupus Research Alliance, AMPEL BioSolutions, Carematix, Verizon and Samsung. Another study, entitled Dynamic Imaging to Assess Variation in Lupus Nephritis (DIVINE), has the potential to replace standard invasive surgical biopsy with sophisticated MRI technology to assess lupus nephritis and better tailor treatment decisions based on disease activity. This study is a collaboration between the Lupus Research Alliance, AMPEL BioSolutions and ImageAnalysis. The Lupus Research Alliance, in partnership with Merck/EMD Serono is collaborating on a phase II clinical study to evaluate M2951, a novel inhibitor of Brutons Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) in Lupus, within the Lupus Research Alliance Lupus Clinical Investigators Network (LuCIN). Although BTK inhibitors are used as a therapy to treat individuals with blood cancer disorders, the mechanism of action of BTK suggests a use for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases, including Lupus. Up to 20 LuCIN centers geographically disbursed throughout North America ""The Lupus Research Alliance is excited and proud to take the lead in conducting clinical trials that will accelerate the process of developing new treatments for lupus, and improve tools to diagnose and monitor the disease,"" said Albert Roy Click here for more information about LuCIN and clinical trials. About Lupus Lupus is a chronic, complex autoimmune disease that affects millions of people worldwide. More than 90% of lupus sufferers are women, mostly young women between the ages of 15 to 44. Women of color are especially at risk. In lupus, the immune system, which is designed to protect against infection, creates antibodies that attack the bodys own tissues and organs -- the kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, blood, skin, and joints. About the Lupus Research Alliance The Lupus Research Alliance leads the quest to free the world from lupus through the power of science. The 501 (c)(3) is the only international private funder devoted to lupus research. The organization propels lupus research in new directions to pursue better treatments while driving to a cure.

The drug is 22 times more expensive than when the company acquired it in late 2013. Scroll for more content... The sticker shock for Horizon Pharmas Vimovo drug is magnified by the fact that the painkillers two main ingredients can be purchased separately -- for just $36. Although patients typically pay just a fraction of the price for Vimovo, the dramatic price increase underlines what critics describe as a murky and wasteful system that ultimately leads to higher health care costs for all Americans. A spokesman for Dublin-based Horizon said that the $2,979 price does not reflect ""the cost to patients or the cost to the system."" The company said it has programs to ensure that commercially-insured patients have access ""at an affordable price"" -- even if the patients insurance refuses to cover the cost. Horizon estimates that 98% of all insured Vimovo patients pay $10 or less out of pocket. The drug industry has come under increasing pressure from a series of scandals in recent years, including extreme price hikes on an AIDS drug by ""pharma bro"" Martin Shkreli and on lifesaving allergy treatment EpiPen by Mylan. President Trump has repeatedly vowed to bring drug prices down. Just last month, Trump promised in during his State of the Union Address that his administration will work to fix the ""injustice of high drug prices."" The day after Trumps speech, Horizon raised the average wholesale price on Vimovo by 9.9% to $2,979 per bottle. Horizon confirmed to CNNMoney the price increase, which was first reported by The Financial Times. Its the latest in a series of about a dozen price hikes for Vimovo, which was listed at just $138 per 60-pill bottle in November 2013. Thats when Horizon acquired the drug from AstraZeneca and began raising prices. Today, the painkiller accounts for just over 10% of Horizons annual sales, providing cash the company uses to develop treatments for rare diseases. Related: How Trump plans to cut prescription drug prices Vimovo is especially controversial because it was created by combining naproxen, which is sold under the brand name Aleve, and esomeprazole, a medicine that lowers the risk of stomach problems caused by pain relievers. Those ingredients can be purchased by patients very cheaply separately. However, Horizon said that Vimovo is a special formulation thats not the same as simply combining the two main ingredients. A Horizon spokesman noted there are no FDA-approved generic, over-the-counter or clinically ""equivalent"" medicines to Vimovo. Still, Horizon warned investors in an SEC filing in November that the ""higher cost"" of Vimovo compared with generic or branded forms of their active ingredients ""may limit adoption by physicians, patients and healthcare payers."" The company said ""we have faced challenges due to pharmacists increasingly switching a patients intended prescription"" from Vimovo to a generic or over-the-counter brand of its active ingredient. The sticker shock led at least two large pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate with drug makers on behalf of employers and health insurers, to balk. Express Scripts and CVS Caremark put Vimovo on their exclusion lists until last year. To counter the pricing concerns, Horizon has entered into rebate agreements with pharmacy benefit managers that lower the cost. An Express Scripts spokeswoman said that Vimovo is currently on its non-preferred list. ""This simply means it is not excluded from coverage, but also is not preferred,"" she said. CVS Caremark did not respond to a request for comment. Related: These states want to import cheaper drugs from Canada Pricing in the pharmaceutical supply chain is notoriously-murky, despite the enormous consequences on the nations bloated health care costs. Confidential rebates and side deals between drug makers, PBMs and insurers make it almost impossible to determine who is really cashing in when drug prices go up. ""There is no transparency. Its a big black box,"" said Annabel Samimy, an analyst at Stifel Financial who covers Horizon. Consider how Vimovos net price -- the amount that Horizon makes after rebates -- has recently gone down. Horizons filings indicate that Vimovo sales tumbled 54% through the first three quarters of 2017 due mostly to ""lower net pricing."" ""What you see between the gross price and net price is a big bubble -- and we dont know where the savings are passed on to,"" Samimy said. ""You need to understand whos in the middle between the manufacturers and the patient."" Samimy noted that pharmacy benefit managers and insurers are extremely profitable even as patients grapple with higher premiums and some drug makers deal with lower net pricing. ""The system in the U.S. has created warped pricing. Everyone points fingers at each other and nothing gets fixed,"" said Samimy.""SOURCE American Association of Kidney Patients AAKP EXPANDS GOUT EDUCATION PROGRAMS FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES TAMPA, Fla.

AKF will hold a Facebook Live event at 1 p.m. (EDT) on May 22, “The truth about gout and kidney disease,” to help kidney patients with gout better understand this chronic condition. AKF’s Facebook Live event will feature a rheumatologist, Dr. Oliver J. Lawless, director of the Center for Arthritis, Immunology and Environmental Disorders, and Steven Winfree, a kidney transplant patient who suffers from chronic gout. It can be viewed on AKF’s Facebook page and viewers may pose questions to the participants. The organization also announced two important new initiatives related to gout: AKF has joined the Alliance for Gout Awareness, a national coalition of diverse consumer and patient stakeholders working to reduce the stigma around gout and empower patients by improving public understanding of the disease. AKF is developing a national campaign around gout and kidney disease, expected to launch this summer. Aimed at people with chronic gout, the campaign will include educational information about gout as well as a downloadable tool for people to use as a resource. The campaign is supported by an educational grant from Horizon Pharma. “It’s critical that we work together as a community to provide educational resources for kidney patients so they are better able to manage their gout and reduce painful symptoms,” said LaVarne A. Burton, president and chief executive officer of the American Kidney Fund. “We look forward to working with the Alliance for Gout Awareness to bring attention to this disease not only on National Gout Awareness Day, but all year long. And we are grateful to Horizon Pharma for its generous grant that will help us educate kidney patients and the public about the connection between kidney disease and gout.” Gout is a painful form of inflammatory arthritis that can affect anyone when urate crystals form in the joints due to high levels of uric acid in the blood. The overproduction of crystals and the body’s under-excretion of them can lead to gout attacks, which often occur suddenly, commonly waking up people in the middle of the night with a burning sensation in the big toe. People with gout can also experience painful flares in their ankles, feet, knees, hands and wrists. Because the kidneys filter and excrete uric acid, people with kidney disease are more likely to experience a buildup of urate crystals.

The drug is 22 times more expensive than when the company acquired it in late 2013. The sticker shock for Horizon Pharmas Vimovo drug is magnified by the fact that the painkillers two main ingredients can be purchased separately -- for just $36. Although patients typically pay just a fraction of the price for Vimovo, the dramatic price increase underlines what critics describe as a murky and wasteful system that ultimately leads to higher health care costs for all Americans. A spokesman for Dublin-based Horizon said that the $2,979 price does not reflect ""the cost to patients or the cost to the system."" The company said it has programs to ensure that commercially-insured patients have access ""at an affordable price"" -- even if the patients insurance refuses to cover the cost. Horizon estimates that 98% of all insured Vimovo patients pay $10 or less out of pocket. The drug industry has come under increasing pressure from a series of scandals in recent years, including extreme price hikes on an AIDS drug by ""pharma bro"" Martin Shkreli and on lifesaving allergy treatment EpiPen by Mylan. President Trump has repeatedly vowed to bring drug prices down. Just last month, Trump promised in during his State of the Union Address that his administration will work to fix the ""injustice of high drug prices."" The day after Trumps speech, Horizon raised the average wholesale price on Vimovo by 9.9% to $2,979 per bottle. Horizon confirmed to CNNMoney the price increase, which was first reported by The Financial Times. Its the latest in a series of about a dozen price hikes for Vimovo, which was listed at just $138 per 60-pill bottle in November 2013. Thats when Horizon acquired the drug from AstraZeneca and began raising prices. Today, the painkiller accounts for just over 10% of Horizons annual sales, providing cash the company uses to develop treatments for rare diseases. Vimovo is especially controversial because it was created by combining naproxen, which is sold under the brand name Aleve, and esomeprazole, a medicine that lowers the risk of stomach problems caused by pain relievers. Those ingredients can be purchased by patients very cheaply separately. However, Horizon said that Vimovo is a special formulation thats not the same as simply combining the two main ingredients. A Horizon spokesman noted there are no FDA-approved generic, over-the-counter or clinically ""equivalent"" medicines to Vimovo. Still, Horizon warned investors in an SEC filing in November that the ""higher cost"" of Vimovo compared with generic or branded forms of their active ingredients ""may limit adoption by physicians, patients and healthcare payers."" The company said ""we have faced challenges due to pharmacists increasingly switching a patients intended prescription"" from Vimovo to a generic or over-the-counter brand of its active ingredient. The sticker shock led at least two large pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate with drug makers on behalf of employers and health insurers, to balk. Express Scripts and CVS Caremark put Vimovo on their exclusion lists until last year. To counter the pricing concerns, Horizon has entered into rebate agreements with pharmacy benefit managers that lower the cost. An Express Scripts spokeswoman said that Vimovo is currently on its non-preferred list. ""This simply means it is not excluded from coverage, but also is not preferred,"" she said. CVS Caremark did not respond to a request for comment. Pricing in the pharmaceutical supply chain is notoriously-murky, despite the enormous consequences on the nations bloated health care costs. Confidential rebates and side deals between drug makers, PBMs and insurers make it almost impossible to determine who is really cashing in when drug prices go up. ""There is no transparency. Its a big black box,"" said Annabel Samimy, an analyst at Stifel Financial who covers Horizon. Consider how Vimovos net price -- the amount that Horizon makes after rebates -- has recently gone down. Horizons filings indicate that Vimovo sales tumbled 54% through the first three quarters of 2017 due mostly to ""lower net pricing."" ""What you see between the gross price and net price is a big bubble -- and we dont know where the savings are passed on to,"" Samimy said. ""You need to understand whos in the middle between the manufacturers and the patient."" Samimy noted that pharmacy benefit managers and insurers are extremely profitable even as patients grapple with higher premiums and some drug makers deal with lower net pricing. ""The system in the U.S. has created warped pricing. Everyone points fingers at each other and nothing gets fixed,"" said Samimy. TM & © 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson 03 Jan 2018 06:40AM Share this content Bookmark NEW YORK: Drugmakers opened the new year by raising U.S. prices on dozens of medicines, but early data showed the increases generally remained within a 10 percent self-imposed limit in response to a backlash from consumers and politicians. Soaring U.S. prices for both branded and generic drugs have sparked public outrage and government investigations over the past few years. ""Drug price increases are somewhat more constrained in 2017 and 2018 than they have been previously,"" Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. Allergan Inc raised prices on 18 different drugs, including dry eye treatment Restasis and irritable bowel syndrome drug Linzess, by 9.5 percent, according to a research note released by Jefferies on Tuesday. Jefferies cited data collected by Medi-Span Price Rx and refers to list price increases, before potentially significant discounts and rebates that drugmakers provide to win preferred coverage by insurers. Medi-Span did not respond to requests to confirm the data. Allergans chief executive, Brent Saunders, in late 2016 pledged to keep price increases below 10 percent as part of what he called the companys ""Social Contract with Patients."" Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur said the increases will be the only ones taken on those brands in 2018, adding that discounts to various payers should bring the actual increases to consumers down to the low single digits. Other drugmakers raising prices include Amgen Inc , Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc and Horizon Pharma , according to Jefferies and Cowen. Amgen raised the price on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drug Enbrel by 9.7 percent and Teva increased prices on its ProAir HFA and ProAir RespiClick asthma inhalers by 6 and 3 percent, respectively. Drug price increases are coming under more scrutiny from states. California Governor Jerry Brown in October signed legislation requiring drug manufacturers to give 60-day notice if prices are raised more than 16 percent over a two-year period. Shares of Allergan rose 4.1 percent on Tuesday, while Teva and Horizon Pharma shares were up 0.8 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.

MARSHALL — Young Kaylee and Evelyn Juutilainen have a lot in common. They both scrunch up their nose when they smile, enjoy playing on the family’s iPad and like drinking ice tea. Both also have a rare disease called cystinosis — they’re two of about 2,000 people worldwide to have it. “I have cystinosis and the baby does, too,” 7-year-old Kaylee said. “Sometimes it’s hard having cystinosis. You have to take a lot of medicine.” Cystinosis is a rare genetic metabolic disease that causes an amino acid called cystine to accumulate in various organs of the body. “(Kaylee and Evelyn) are 2 in about 2,000 worldwide, 2 in about 500 in the U.S. and 2 of about 7 in Minnesota,” mom Dai Juutilainen said. Today marks the first-ever Cystinosis Awareness Day — something Kaylee is very much aware of and ready to celebrate. “Kaylee is making a pamphlet to give to the kids in her class and she’s going to tell them about it, too,” Juutilainen said. According to the Cystinosis Research Network, cystine crystals accumulate in a person’s kidneys, eyes, liver, muscles, pancreas, brain and white blood cells. “Cystinosis kids have crystals in their eyes so it makes it hard to go outside when it’s really sunny out because it hurts their eyes,” Kaylee said. “I have glasses and my glasses turn dark in the sunlight. Cystinosis kids also really like salt because it helps them in a way.” Without specific treatment, children with cystinosis develop end stage kidney failure around 9 years old, according to the CRN. So Marshall residents Dai and Ryan Juutilainen spend an enormous amount of time giving life-saving medicines to their daughters. “Every 12 hours, Kaylee takes Procysbi to lower the cystine levels, growth hormone shots to help grow, Cystran eye drops to help dissolve the cystine crystals in her cornea — that’s up to 6 times a day — and then meds to help with iron, vitamin D and other electrolyte levels,” Dai Juutilainen said. “Some are once daily and others are multiple times a day.” Currently, Kaylee takes 9 medications daily. “The medications can cause nausea and vomiting,” Dai Juutilainen said. “The primary medication can also cause appetite suppression. When you add growth issues to the electrolyte issues, the girls have trouble staying on the growth charts.” While some of the drugs can be harsh on the little girls’ bodies, a fairly-new extended release medicine is helping alleviate some of the challenges. “Both girls tire out quite easily, but at least now they have extended release medication,” Dai Juutilainen said. “When Kaylee was originally diagnosed, her cystine medication was every 6 hours, so we had to wake her up and she was continually tired until the new medication came out.” Juutilainen said Evelyn, who will be 2 years old in June, is the youngest person to take the extended release medication. Since the dose comes in little micro capsules, there were still some challenges. “With Kaylee, we’d mix it with applesauce and give it to her,” Juutilainen said. “But Evie wasn’t eating food yet, so I had to figure out how to mix it in something that was thick enough that I could give it to her in the syringe and not have it stick in the syringe, but not so thick that she would gag. I ended up mixing it with baby food, but sometimes we’d give it to her and think she swallowed it, but she hadn’t.” Ryan Juutilainen said “both have feeding tubes in their stomach,” so nutrients or medicine can be given that way if necessary. “It’s to get medicine through our tube when a special day comes up and we might not be able to take our medicine,” Kaylee said. Kaylee was diagnosed with cystinosis at 16 months old. She spent Christmas 2011 in a Twin Cities hospital. She was also in the hospital for her third and fifth birthdays. “Some of the things — both good and bad — that seem small for other kids are a big deal for them,” Dai Juutilainen said. “We have to be careful when they are sick as they can go from OK to being admitted to the hospital within a few hours. They drink gallons of water every day, and when they are sick or during the summer, they do not show signs of dehydration until they are to the point of requiring IVs to get them rehydrated.” Evelyn was diagnosed between 7-8 weeks old. “Since Kaylee had it, they tested Evelyn early,” Juutilainen said. “The earliest signs of cystinosis are usually failure to thrive, electrolytes being off and drinking a lot of water.” Kaylee and Evie don’t go anywhere without having something to drink with them. “The cystinosis causes a type of kidney damage called Renal Fanconi’s Syndrome,” Juutilainen said. “Basically, the tubes in the kidneys are damaged by the cystine crystals and then don’t filter the fluids — it just runs right through. A normal kidney is like a bucket that fills up and then empties out in a cycle, whereas with the girls, their bucket is full of holes and is impossible to fill up.” That means the sisters drink insane amounts of fluids a day, just to stay hydrated. “They drink quite a bit because the kidneys flush out a lot of the fluids,” Ryan Juutilainen said. “They’re thirsty a lot.” Dai Juutilainen said that when Evelyn was in the hospital in January, the goal for her just to stay hydrated was close to 3 gallons. “That’s a lot for an 18-month- old just to maintain her 16-17 pound weight,” she said. “That also means they go to the bathroom a lot. Evelyn can soak through a diaper in one pee.” Craving salt and having extreme thirst are common for individuals with cystinosis. “Me and Evie really like to drink tea,” Kaylee said. “We got through about 10 packets a day between Evelyn and me. Also, my favorite food is bacon.” Juutilainen said Kaylee would eat an entire package of bacon if you’d let her. “If you take her bacon, be prepared to lose a hand,” Juutilainen said. “And (Kaylee and Evie) are the kind of kids that go into a restaurant, pick up the salt shaker and try to drink it. They crave salt. There are some with cystinosis that take salt supplements because their sodium is low.” While she’s only 7, Kaylee knows a great deal about her condition. She also remembers a lot of the details from hospital visits. “Evie has been in the hospital four times,” Kaylee said. “The first time was when she got a fever. They have a playroom for younger kids to go in and play, and me and (my sister) Tracy would go there a lot. I really liked the little red wagon. It was my favorite thing.” Kaylee actually liked sleeping in a little red wagon during one of her three hospital stays. “I did not like sleeping in anything else,” she said. While they do not have cystinosis, Kaylee’s and Evie’s sisters, Rhyana, 18, Holly, 15, and Tracy, 6, know a lot about the rare disease and its complications. “Kaylee and Evie have different cystinosis,” Tracy said. Dai Juutilainen explained that Kaylee’s biggest issue is her potassium level dropping, while Evelyn’s is her calcium level. “Evelyn is healthy now, but in the last year, she was hospitalized for tetany, which is low calcium that causes muscles to cramp,” she said. “That was in April 2017 for about three weeks, but then ended up back in the hospital 48 hours later for another two weeks.” Juutilainen said Evelyn takes the same medications as Kaylee, plus a few more. “Many of the medicines interact with one another, so she gets meds every hour,” Juutilainen said. “And with the tetany, if you don’t catch it quick enough, it can affect her heart.” According to their parents, Rhyana, Holly and Tracy also offer a lot of support, as do extended family members. “I am super thankful to their big sisters who watch them so we can work,” Dai Juutilainen said. “I oftentimes feel bad when we have to say no when they want to do something because we don’t have the money. There are times when it seems like we are just about caught up and getting on track, then one ends up in the hospital and we take 2-20 steps backwards.” Fortunately, there are family members who live in the cities near the University of Minnesota Masonic Children’s Hospital, but there are still challenges. “I’m grateful for extended family, but it still means I am away from home and work, which in return affects their dad and big sisters in that they have to adjust schedules to make sure someone is home, too,” Dai Juutilainen said. Both girls also go to physical, speech and occupational therapy every week. There’s also making sure staff at Park Side Elementary, where Kaylee is a first-grader, are in the loop. “The schools have been quite supportive with Kaylee,” Juutilainen said. “The nurses have gotten to know her and her little quirks. They make sure she gets her medication and a nap if she needs it. They have learned enough that they don’t let her get away with things and also when to call me because she is ‘off’ her normal.” In many ways, Kaylee is like other children her age. She loves to laugh. Her favorite animals are puppies. And she is losing some of her teeth. Kaylee also wants people to know that having cystinosis makes her and Evie special. “Sometimes I can’t run as fast because sometimes my leg hurts,” Kaylee said. “Then I go slower.” In the past year, the family has taken part in two cystinosis-focused events. “We went to a cystinosis convention in Seattle and Utah,” Kaylee said. “So two times, we made a Cystinosis Cyd. Cystinosis Cyd tells you some facts about cystinosis kids.” Juutilainen said a town hall meeting in Seattle was presented by Horizon Pharmaceutical, which makes the Procysbi medication. “We got to hang out with other families and Kaylee got to meet some other kids with cystinosis,” she said. “We had some meeting time to compare notes on daily life and challenges, discuss issues with meds and find solutions as well as meet some doctors and social workers who gave information on ongoing studies, kidney camps for kids and types of assistance that may be available.” In Utah at an annual convention, there were various specialists, patients, parents and drug representatives. “There was time to chat with anyone and everyone,” Juutilainen said. “They talked about cystinosis — the medications and new things on the horizon. The little girls got to play, design shirts and pillowcases, and make birds that were part of an art installation. Kaylee also got to see other kids do what she does every day — take medications and usually without hysterics.” Cystinosis is called a recessive genetic disease because parents do not exhibit symptoms, but each of them carries a recessive gene which may cause cystinosis in their children — a 1 in 4 chance, according to the CRN. Every healthy sibling of a child with cystinosis also has a 2 in 3 chance of being a carrier. “Most carriers have no idea that they have it until they have a child with it,” Juutilainen said. “And there is currently no cure for cystinosis, but through some of the gene studies, there is hope that there could be in the future.”""The more science teaches us about head injury, the more football seems to be doomed. But could science also save football? Might medicine offer us a miracle cure for degenerative brain disease? Since 2008, pathologists at Boston University have been repeatedly raising the alarm about the effects of life between the lines, finding ever-greater numbers of cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), suspected to be a consequence of repeated head injury, in the brains of deceased NFL players. The current count is 110 out of 111. While the number of diagnosed concussions in pro football was down last season (from 275 to 244), it was still higher than the average over the past five years (243). Unsure of whether the game is worth the risk, several players have walked away from football in spite of promising careers-49ers linebacker Chris Borland in 15, Bills offensive lineman A.J. Tarpley in 16, Ravens offensive lineman John Urshel in 17. Rule changes and equipment innovations cant alter the contradiction between physics and biology. The average weight of recruits posting a 40-yard dash at the NFL combine is up by 16.8 pounds since 1987, while the average time is a shade faster by 0.05 seconds. The result is that the average momentum of those players is up by 8.4%, in barely more than a generation. Evolution doesnt move that fast. The extra collision energy goes into further rattling our bodies and brains. We are not designed to take these hits. ""With just the amount of physics that I learned to get into medical school and the knowledge of the forces within the brain,"" says Jim Kovach, a medical doctor, lawyer, entrepreneur, and former player, ""my personal opinion is that it would be impossible to truly mitigate the coup-contrecoup-the shaking of the brain, the physical contusion of the brain and the cerebrospinal fluid that is caused by head impacts."" While Kovach doubts concussions can be eradicated from football, the seven-year veteran of the league is hoping the long-term consequences of head impacts can be averted. ""I was a relatively undersized middle linebacker who could diagnose plays really well,"" he says. ""[But] I had a career that was marked by very good form-putting my helmet square in other peoples chests. Thats what linebackers do."" In August 2016, researchers at a Novato, Calif., based company called Raptor Pharmaceuticals discovered an interesting type of molecule: relatively biologically inert, but transformed into substances similar to existing drugs when exposed to free radicals called reaction oxygen species (ROS). Dubbed captons, these molecules promised to have few unwanted side effects, and to more easily pass through the blood-brain barrier-the semipermeable membrane that separates circulating blood from the extracellular fluid in the brain-than typical neuroprotective drugs. Concussions can lead to the creation of higher concentrations of reactive oxygen species in the brain, raising the oxidative stress on neurons. If that stress is too high, the neurons may die and trigger a cascade that affects other nearby cells. Head injury can also lead to the release of too much of a neurotransmitter called glutamate, overloading neurons and disrupting their ability to function normally. This can also lead to neuron death, and neuroprotectants that dampen the over-excitation of the cells can be used to calm the glutamate storm. The theory behind captons is that they could be taken as a prophylactic before injury. When a concussion causes a spike in ROS, the captons will react with those free radicals and neutralize the oxidative stress. Additionally, the transformed captons will then act as neuroprotectants to de-excite the neurons at the site of injury, and only there. ""[Pathology after concussion] is like a ripple effect,"" says Sara Isbell, Mercaptors CEO and co-founder, ""we prevent those ripples from expanding."" When Raptor was bought out by Horizon Pharma in September 2016, Isbell and other members of the research team founded a new company called Mercaptor Discoveries to develop captons. Kovach, who has served on the NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee, joined Mercaptors advisory board in August. Kovachs final year playing college football at Kentucky, 1978, was also his first year in medical school. The Saints drafted him in the fourth round the following June, and he brought his medical textbooks with him. He played through the 1985 season-a year after he gained his MD-then studied law in retirement, graduating from Stanford University in 1990. He then served eight years as the COO for biotech firm Athersys, five years as president of the Buck Institute for Research on Aging, and is now an innovation and entrepreneurship consultant for the UC Davis School of Medicine. Kovach credits his academic studies and later work as a reason for why his mind may be healthier than those of other ex-players. A longitudinal study, begun in 1986, on aging and Alzheimers disease called the ""Nun Study""-the subjects were 678 nuns-has shown connections between learning sophisticated language skills at an early age and a reduced risk of developing AD, and between regular mental exercise and reduced symptoms of AD even when there is underlying brain degeneration. But Kovach has seen too many of his friends and former colleagues taken down by brain disease to be sure that he will be immune. He played in the 1979 Senior Bowl alongside defensive end Mark Gastineau. Gastineau, a 10-year veteran with the Jets, was diagnosed with dementia and both Alzhemiers and Parkinsons diseases last year. Kovach was selected in the same draft as receiver Dwight Clark, and later played with him with the 49ers. Clark announced in March that he has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrigs disease. Saints coach Dick Nolan picked Kovach in 1979. Nolan died after battling both Alzheimers and prostate cancer in 2007. Kovach is sure there are others who may not have a diagnosis, or may not have decided to go public. Captons arent the only potential medical treatments that might offer some sort of cure against the triggering or progression of CTE. Other possibilities include antibodies that might direct the immune system to destroy types of protein molecules that accumulate during the disease, or gene editing to replace genetic variants that appear to raise the risk of developing CTE. Mercaptor is currently studying captons in animal models. Isbell predicts that by mid 2019, the company could start initial human trials to test for adverse reactions in healthy patients, and that within five years there could be clinical trials for patients with, or at risk of, developing neurodegenerative diseases. If the research holds up, and if it leads to the development of new neuroprotective drugs, Kovach says hell be a willing patient. ""Ill raise my hand and say Yes, me too,"" he says. ""Its naïve to think that theres no chance that I could get [CTE]. Its tragic to believe that you will, but you cant believe that you wont, either."" • We have a newsletter, and you can subscribe, and its free .

(Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Leslie Adler)""(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tuesday, May 22, is National Gout Awareness Day and the American Kidney Fund (AKF) is joining a nationwide effort to educate people about the connections between kidney disease and gout—an extremely painful form of arthritis that affects more than 8 million people annually. AKF will hold a Facebook Live event at 1 p.m. (EDT) on May 22, “The truth about gout and kidney disease,” to help kidney patients with gout better understand this chronic condition. AKF’s Facebook Live event will feature a rheumatologist, Dr. Oliver J. Lawless, director of the Center for Arthritis, Immunology and Environmental Disorders, and Steven Winfree, a kidney transplant patient who suffers from chronic gout. It can be viewed on AKF’s Facebook page and viewers may pose questions to the participants. The organization also announced two important new initiatives related to gout: AKF has joined the Alliance for Gout Awareness, a national coalition of diverse consumer and patient stakeholders working to reduce the stigma around gout and empower patients by improving public understanding of the disease. AKF is developing a national campaign around gout and kidney disease, expected to launch this summer. Aimed at people with chronic gout, the campaign will include educational information about gout as well as a downloadable tool for people to use as a resource. The campaign is supported by an educational grant from Horizon Pharma. “It’s critical that we work together as a community to provide educational resources for kidney patients so they are better able to manage their gout and reduce painful symptoms,” said LaVarne A. Burton, president and chief executive officer of the American Kidney Fund. “We look forward to working with the Alliance for Gout Awareness to bring attention to this disease not only on National Gout Awareness Day, but all year long. And we are grateful to Horizon Pharma for its generous grant that will help us educate kidney patients and the public about the connection between kidney disease and gout.” Gout is a painful form of inflammatory arthritis that can affect anyone when urate crystals form in the joints due to high levels of uric acid in the blood. The overproduction of crystals and the body’s under-excretion of them can lead to gout attacks, which often occur suddenly, commonly waking up people in the middle of the night with a burning sensation in the big toe. People with gout can also experience painful flares in their ankles, feet, knees, hands and wrists. Because the kidneys filter and excrete uric acid, people with kidney disease are more likely to experience a buildup of urate crystals. About the American Kidney Fund As the nation’s leading nonprofit working on behalf of the 30 million Americans with kidney disease, the American Kidney Fund is dedicated to ensuring that every kidney patient has access to health care, and that every person at risk for kidney disease is empowered to prevent it.

Recognizing the limited treatments for lupus, LuCIN was organized, managed and is funded by the Lupus Research Alliance to address the slow pace of development of new lupus therapies. With 59 of the most prestigious academic research centers in major cities throughout North America , LuCIN provides a framework to quickly and cost-effectively test potential new therapies, as well as methods to diagnose and monitor response to treatment. Managing lupus is challenging because no two cases are alike and symptoms vary widely. While better treatments and medical care have improved life expectancy, lupus is still not adequately controlled in many people, and the disease often progresses. Also, many current therapies carry risks of debilitating side effects. Inaugural LuCIN Clinical Studies The Lupus Research Alliance has forged several strategic partnerships with the pharmaceutical/biotech industry to launch its first portfolio of clinical studies within LuCIN. The non-profit organization is collaborating with Celgene Corporation to further study CC-220 , an oral drug being developed to treat systemic lupus erythematosus. Based on results of earlier studies, as well as the unmet medical need for safe and effective oral therapies, Celgene will further evaluate this drug candidate within LuCIN in a global multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical study. In partnership with Pfizer Inc ., a non-interventional clinical study entitled VA lidation in LU pus of an E lectronic Patient Reported Outcomes Tool (VALUE) has been initiated within LuCIN to test a custom smartphone app enabling lupus patients to report on their health-related quality of life and fatigue and other symptoms in real time rather than completing surveys during visits to physicians offices. The app was designed with input from people with lupus. Pfizer Inc., the Lupus Research Alliance, AMPEL BioSolutions and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. jointly developed the new mobile app, using the Apple ResearchKit platform and building on existing research tools that have been validated in lupus. In conjunction with Horizon Pharma , the clinical study entitled R ayos I nhibits F atigue in L upus E rythematosus (RIFLE) will test the effect of RAYOS ® on severe fatigue and morning stiffness often experienced by people with lupus. RAYOS is the first low-dose, delayed-release form of the steroid prednisone, a widely prescribed anti-inflammatory drug. RIFLE also tests a customized mobile app to measure fatigue, health-related quality of life, disease activity and morning stiffness throughout the trial. RIFLE is a collaboration between the Lupus Research Alliance, AMPEL BioSolutions, Carematix, Verizon and Samsung. Another study, entitled Dynamic Imaging to Assess Variation in Lupus Nephritis (DIVINE) , has the potential to replace standard invasive surgical biopsy with sophisticated MRI technology to assess lupus nephritis and better tailor treatment decisions based on disease activity. This study is a collaboration between the Lupus Research Alliance, AMPEL BioSolutions and ImageAnalysis. The Lupus Research Alliance, in partnership with Merck/EMD Serono is collaborating on a phase II clinical study to evaluate M2951 , a novel inhibitor of Brutons Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) in Lupus, within the Lupus Research Alliance Lupus Clinical Investigators Network (LuCIN). Although BTK inhibitors are used as a therapy to treat individuals with blood cancer disorders, the mechanism of action of BTK suggests a use for the potential treatment of autoimmune diseases, including Lupus. Up to 20 LuCIN centers geographically disbursed throughout North America will be participating in the clinical study. ""The Lupus Research Alliance is excited and proud to take the lead in conducting clinical trials that will accelerate the process of developing new treatments for lupus, and improve tools to diagnose and monitor the disease,"" said Albert Roy , Executive Director of LuCIN. ""These first trials are landmarks for the lupus community and will offer patients a meaningful way to get involved and make a real difference in improving care.""

More than 90% of lupus sufferers are women, mostly young women between the ages of 15 to 44. Women of color are especially at risk. In lupus, the immune system, which is designed to protect against infection, creates antibodies that attack the bodys own tissues and organs -- the kidneys, brain, heart, lungs, blood, skin, and joints. About the Lupus Research Alliance The Lupus Research Alliance leads the quest to free the world from lupus through the power of science. The 501 (c)(3) is the only international private funder devoted to lupus research. The organization propels lupus research in new directions to pursue better treatments while driving to a cure. Because the Lupus Research Alliance Board of Directors funds all administrative and fundraising costs, 100% of all donations goes to support lupus research programs. And with pivotal discoveries, the Lupus Research Alliance is breaking through.

AKF will hold a Facebook Live event at 1 p.m. (EDT) on May 22, “The truth about gout and kidney disease,” to help kidney patients with gout better understand this chronic condition. AKF’s Facebook Live event will feature a rheumatologist, Dr. Oliver J. Lawless, director of the Center for Arthritis, Immunology and Environmental Disorders, and Steven Winfree, a kidney transplant patient who suffers from chronic gout. It can be viewed on AKF’s Facebook page and viewers may pose questions to the participants. The organization also announced two important new initiatives related to gout: AKF has joined the Alliance for Gout Awareness, a national coalition of diverse consumer and patient stakeholders working to reduce the stigma around gout and empower patients by improving public understanding of the disease. AKF is developing a national campaign around gout and kidney disease, expected to launch this summer. Aimed at people with chronic gout, the campaign will include educational information about gout as well as a downloadable tool for people to use as a resource. The campaign is supported by an educational grant from Horizon Pharma. “It’s critical that we work together as a community to provide educational resources for kidney patients so they are better able to manage their gout and reduce painful symptoms,” said LaVarne A.

Photo: Carl Jordan Castro / For Connecticut Health I-Team Image 3 of 3 Back to Gallery Thousands of consumers statewide are experiencing sticker shock at the pharmacy this year after increases in deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses for employer-sponsored insurance, forcing some to choose between their health and their finances. Since 2003, drug costs in Connecticut have increased faster than prices across the nation, reports the nonprofit Connecticut Health Policy Project. The advocacy group also found that Connecticut residents spend more per person on prescriptions than residents in all states except Delaware and that rate is rising much faster than in other states. This is causing some states to step in to control drug costs. “Shame does not work. Competition does not work. What’s left? Governments saying what they’re going to pay for the drug,” said Jill Zorn, a senior policy officer at the advocacy organization Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut. “The states are acting because the federal government isn’t.” States are stepping in to control costs. Earlier this year, the Connecticut State Healthcare Cabinet recommended , among other measures, the creation of a Drug Review Board authorized to investigate drug manufacturers’ pricing. The cabinet also called for transparency in business practices and for consumers to be charged an amount based on the negotiated price of a drug. Nevada was first among states to pass an insulin drug pricing transparency bill, and has since been followed by other states. Soaring prices According to the State Comptroller’s Office, the total net costs of prescription drugs in the state employee health plan rose 29 percent, from $257.6 million in 2014 to $332.3 million in 2017, with diabetes drugs the most expensive therapeutic class. Some of the companies to hike prices on dozens of medications by more than 9 percent this year include Allergan, Insys Therapeutics Inc., Horizon Pharma Ltd., and Teva Ltd, according to Jefferies LLC, a New York-based investment advisory firm. Pharma companies are quick to note that most net price increases have been modest. “For Pfizer’s U.S. biopharma business, as of the third quarter of 2017, the weighted average net selling price increase year to date was 3 percent,” said Sally Beatty, a Pfizer Inc. spokesperson. But Piyush Bansal, a senior analyst with Frost & Sullivan, points out that Pfizer, which maintains a large R&D facility in Groton, hiked U.S. prices for 91 drugs by an average of 20 percent in 2017. And for Big Pharma, price increases have outpaced the demand. “Maintaining profit margin was the key driver behind price increase rather than demand-supply,” Bansal said. Legislators say they hear complaints from constituents about drug costs weekly. “Drug prices are way too high, and there are laws on the books that protect drug companies,” said U.S. Senator Chris Murphy, D-Conn. “I want to change those laws, to stop drug companies from overcharging and to lower costs by allowing Medicare to negotiate directly with drug companies.” Other obstacles Adding to patients’ woes, pharmaceutical companies have extended patent rights on blockbuster drugs to limit competition. For example, the patent for Humira from AbbVie Pharma expired in 2014. But the company filed multiple patents surrounding Humira, from dosage tweaks to delivery methods, avoiding competition from generic products. Insurers, too, are driving patients to ration their medication. Nora Duncan, state director at the American Association of Retired Persons, said seniors in particular are affected, among other things, by insurers switching plan formularies in the middle of the year. “HB 7123 is a good bill on trying to limit how much can change. There is a lot of opposition from the pharmaceutical lobby; but that information should stay consistent through the calendar year.” The bill is before the legislature for consideration. The Connecticut Health Policy Project data show that net pharmacy spending minus rebates from Connecticut’s Medicaid program tripled from 2000 to 2017. After rebates, Medicaid’s pharmacy costs decreased from $542 million in 2015 to $465 million in 2017, a drop of over 14 percent, said David Dearborn, spokesperson at the Connecticut Department of Social Services. Personal struggles But for most consumers, prices cannot drop soon enough. For Todd Gray, who lives and works in the Hartford area, his troubles began when the deductible under his insurance plan shot up from $3,000 last year to $7,300 in 2018. Along with it, his blood sugar rose to more than 300 milligrams per deciliter as he experienced blurred vision and edginess, culminating in an “episode of yelling” at work. The 55-year-old diabetic had skipped his medication in January after sticker shock at the pharmacy. “Walgreens said I had to pay $1,100 for one month’s supply of Humalog.” an injectable insulin, he said. “I didn’t have the money, so I didn’t buy it.” Humalog does not have a generic equivalent. A concerned colleague did some research and found Humalog online at Blink Health for $360. “I pre-pay and pick it up at Walmart,” said Gray, who also shells out $350 per month for Lantus, another diabetes drug without a generic alternative. Part of the ire against Big Pharma is that the numbers simply don’t add up. For example, it costs just under $5 to produce a 10 ml vial of analog insulin , according to the Type 1 Diabetes Defense Fund. Eli Lilly’s launch price for Humalog in 1996 was $21, and subsequent competition from other insulin makers did not drive down the price. Instead, manufacturers began to increase prices in tandem and Humalog pharmacy price starts at $500, according to GoodRx website. Despite the savings with Blink Health, Gray does not inject himself with Humalog three times a day as prescribed. “I do it once a day, or sometimes twice, so it can last longer.” His blood sugar is still not controlled. This story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team ( c-hit.org ).""HARTFORD — As the administrator of the state employees health insurance plan, State Comptroller Kevin Lembo is taking steps to try and block the use of “outrageously expensive specialty drugs.” Lembo said a review of pharmacy practices confirmed that the vast majority of prescriptions dispensed by two Connecticut pharmacies through the state health plan are for drugs manufactured by just one single drug manufacturer, Horizon Pharma. At those two pharmacies, according to claims data, 70 percent of prescriptions they filled for the state plan were for Horizon Pharma products alone, Lembo said. The data raises questions “about what possible incentives are motivating such a high concentration of prescriptions for Horizon’s products,” Lembo added. According to Lembo, “Horizon specializes in expensive drugs — costing more than $1,000 per prescription, in some cases — even though these medications are essentially just combinations of affordable over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen and Pepcid AC or Aleve and Nexium.” A spokesman for Horizon disagrees with Lembo’s assessment and description of its drugs. “At Horizon Pharma, a primary focus is to ensure that patients have access to the medicines their physicians prescribe while limiting their financial burden,” Matt Flesch, executive director of product communications for Horizon, said in an emailed statement. “For clarification, there are no FDA-approved generic, over-the-counter or clinically equivalent medicines to the medicines (DUEXIS and VIMOVO) Mr. Lembo mentions so saying that those medicines are ‘essentially combinations of affordable over-the-counter drugs’ is completely inaccurate.” Read more at CTNewsJunkie.com.""Retrophin and the U.S. subsidiary of Britain’s Horizon Pharma will each donate $3 million over a six-year period to the Rare Disease Institute (RDI) at Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C., helping it to strengthen care available and expand as a “center of excellence” for rare disease patients. “We’re really proud of both these companies for stepping up,” Marshall Summar , MD, director of RDI, said in a phone interview with BioNews Services , which publishes this website. “A lot of donations go towards research or bricks and mortar. But this money will go to clinical studies, case management, social work — a whole host of things that normally you can’t always afford to run in a pediatric children’s hospital. “At the RDI, our goal is to build a network of centers of excellence that we’re helping support and coordinate. These two donations will go a long way towards making it a long-term, stable program,” Summar added. Marshall Summar, MD, is the director of Children’s National’s Rare Disease Institute. (Photo courtesy Children’s National) The Retrophin Rare Disease Network, whose creation was announced in early January, will advance the institute’s efforts to create a global “hub and spoke” model for disseminating and streamlining patient access to optimal care methods among U.S. and foreign peer institutions. The network aims to enhance the field of rare disease medicine by standardizing care models and establishing best practices in diagnosis and treatment . RDI is a first-of-its-kind center focused exclusively on treating both children and adults with rare genetic diseases that remain largely unknown to the general medical community. It is also the first Center of Excellence established by the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD). The institute launched its partnership with NORD in 2017. Children’s National aims to be the first of many of such centers across the United States treating patients with rare diseases, regardless of age. “Retrophin is proud to support the important work that the Children’s National Rare Disease Institute is doing to advance the care and treatment of rare diseases,” Stephen Aselage, CEO of San Diego-based Retrophin, which specializes in rare disease treatments, said in a company press release . “The tremendous difficulty that patients with rare diseases have in getting an accurate diagnosis and early treatment is well-documented. The creation of this network is critical to broadening access to the institute’s innovative resources and programs, and will ultimately lead to expanded specialized care for patients and families in the rare disease community,” Aselage added. Likewise, the Horizon Pharma Clinical Care Endowment — to be given over six years — will fund an expert care team at Children’s National consisting of a clinical geneticists and others, such as genetic counselors, nutritionists and social workers, all specializing in the care of children with rare diseases. “We consistently hear stories from people who spent many years in search of a diagnosis, followed by more years searching for the right team of specialists – suffering through a painful journey with devastating consequences,” said Timothy Walbert, chairman, president and CEO of Horizon, in a company press release . “Our hope is that the Horizon Pharma Clinical Care Endowment and the institute will disrupt this all-too-familiar rare disease trajectory by joining exceptional rare disease specialists together in one place,” he added. Any disease, illness or disorder that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States is considered to be rare, according to the National Institutes of Health. Yet, of the more than 7,000 rare diseases known to exist, fewer than 500 — roughly 5 percent — have a known treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. About one in 10 Americans have a rare disease – approximately 80 percent of which are genetically based. The NIH says more than 80 percent are childhood diseases, and more than a quarter of all children admitted to pediatric hospitals have a rare disease. “We’re working to stabilize the clinical ecosystem in rare diseases, so that physicians have the support they need and patients have a predictable place to come,” Summar told BioNews. “One of the real benefits for them is that diagnoses will be more predictable. And as we roll out the centers of excellence model, it will become multiple but consistent standards.” To date, Children’s National has spent between $10 million and $15 million to refurbish its new clinical and research home at the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center along Georgia Avenue in northwest Washington. The 12-acre property, which was vacated in 2011, includes the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology building, a large parking lot, and a 300-seat lecture hall. The project currently occupies about 12,000 square feet, and will eventually expand to 22,000 square feet, Summar said, estimating its total cost at around $200 million. RDI currently operates out of Children’s National itself. Summar said he expects to be operating at the new location by this fall.""Philip J. Mease Patients with ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis share comparable disease burden and treatment patterns in clinical practice, according findings published in Arthritis Care and Research . The study was the first nationwide analysis characterizing ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) in the United States, according to the researchers. “Our understanding of AS has been around for a long time, with the New York modified AS criteria being published in 1984,” Philip J. Mease , MD, of Seattle Rheumatology Associates, told Healio Rheumatology . “By this definition of disease, classification is based on already established damage observable by plain X-ray of the sacroiliac joints. By this definition, the patients are 2:1 male and predominantly HLA-B27 positive.” Patients with ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis often have comparable disease burden and receive the same treatment in clinical practice, according to researchers. Source:Shutterstock To describe patients with AS and nonradiographic axSpA in the United States, the researchers studied data in the Corrona Psoriatic Arthritis/Spondyloarthritis Registry. Mease and colleagues identified 407 adults with a diagnosis of axSpA who were enrolled in the Corrona registry starting in July 2015. Among those patients, 310 had AS and 97 had nonradiographic axSpA. The researchers analyzed demographics, clinical characteristics, patient-reported outcomes and treatment characteristics for each patient. According to the researchers, patients with nonradiographic axSpA and AS demonstrated similar disease burden in terms of disease activity and function, quality of life, pain, fatigue, absenteeism and work productivity loss. However, patients with nonradiographic axSpA, were younger and demonstrated shorter symptom duration. Among patients with nonradiographic axSpA, 74.2% had previously received biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs , compared with 64.8% among patients with AS. The proportion of patients with nonradiographic axSpA who had current treatment with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs was 63.9%, compared with 61.3% among those with AS. “Up until the publication of this paper, these observations have been primarily made from patient registries outside the U.S., especially Europe and Canada,” Mease said. “That the observations we made in a representative sample of U.S. patients with AS and nonradiographic AxSpA were essentially the same as those in other countries helps with our overall understanding of the natural disease state of AS and its similarity and minor dissimilarities with nonradiographic AxSpA, thus confirming the broader concept of AxSpA as inclusive of a state distinct from or prior to (nonradiographic) a state of greater damage (radiographic AS).” Mease added that their findings suggest that the two conditions represent a “spectrum of disease.” “Additionally, we find that the same types of treatments, especially regarding use of anti-TNF therapy, can be equally effective in the two types of patients, also supporting that they are part of a spectrum of disease rather than being distinct diseases,” he said. “It is good to know that the physicians in the Corrona registry recognize and understand this and use anti-TNFs as much in the nonradiographic as the radiographic group and do not hold back on use of appropriate and effective therapy in case they were to think of the nonradiographic group as less severe or less impacted than the radiographically defined group.” – by Jason Laday Disclosure: The researchers report funding and support from Corrona LLC, AbbVie, Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Crescendo, Eli Lilly and Company, Genentech, Gilead, GSK, Horizon Pharma USA, Janssen, Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Novartis, Pfizer, Roche, Sun-Merck, UCB, and Valeant.

Credit: BSIP/Science Source Patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who had axial involvement exhibited more severe disease, higher disease activity, and greater impairments to quality of life (QoL) compared with patients without axial involvement, according to findings published in The Journal of Rheumatology. Relatively little is known regarding the effects of axial involvement on clinical disease outcomes, leaving questions about the effects of axial PsA on disease activity and QoL mostly unanswered. Investigators wanted to explore these connections further to offer practitioners better insight to improve disease management for their patients. Data on a total of 1530 participants enrolled between March 2013 and March 2016 in the Corrona Psoriatic Arthritis/Spondyloarthritis Registry were analyzed. The cohort included 192 patients with axial PsA (mean age, 50.4 years, 54.0% women, mean disease duration, 12.1 years) and 1338 patients with nonaxial PsA (mean age, 54.4 years, 51.6% women, mean disease duration, 11.4 years) at baseline. Axial involvement was defined by clinician reports or evidence of sacroiliitis on imaging. Rheumatologists and patients also filled out semiannual questionnaires during routine office visits. Patients with axial PsA were younger (P <.001) compared with patients with nonaxial PsA and were more likely to have HLA-B27 positivity (14.1% vs 3.8%, P <.001) and a greater history of biologic use (72.9% vs 59.6%; P <.001) and depression (22.9% vs 12.6%; P <.001). They also demonstrated higher levels of moderate to severe psoriasis using body surface area =3% (42.5% vs 31.5%; P =.005) and nail psoriasis by visual analog scale (VAS; 11.4 vs 6.5; P <.001), as well as more enthesitis (30.7% vs 19.2%, P <.001) and elevated swollen joint counts (5.2 vs 3.5; P =.004) compared with patients with nonaxial PsA. Baseline disease activity measures showed that individuals with axial PsA had less minimal disease activity (30.1% vs 46.2%; P < .001) and higher scores on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (4.7 vs 3.5, P <.001), the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (3.8 vs 2.5; P <.001), and the Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score using C-reactive protein (2.2 vs 1.9; P =.001), vs participants with nonaxial PsA. Levels of C-reactive protein were also significantly elevated compared with levels of those without axial involvement (4.1 vs 2.4; P =.02). Axial involvement also produced worse patient-reported outcomes, with higher pain by VAS (47.7 vs 36.2; P <.001), higher fatigue by VAS (50.2 vs 38.6; P <.001) and greater likelihood of =30 minutes of morning stiffness (83.2% vs 69.3% P <.001) compared with no axial involvement. Physical function on the Health Assessment Questionnaire (0.9 vs 0.6; P <.001) and QoL using the EuroQol VAS (65.3 vs 73.3; P <.001) were also worse in people with axial PsA vs those with nonaxial PsA. Work impairment (32.3% vs 16.8%, P <.001) and overall activity impairment (37.0% vs 18.1%; P <.001) were higher in the axial vs nonaxial group. Related Articles Study limitations included the potential for unmeasured confounders, the possibility that participants frequency or level of care may not represent that of average patients, and the possibility that axial involvement might be overestimated or underestimated in this sample as a consequence of not requiring verification through imaging. “These data highlight the need to monitor patients with PsA for axial symptoms to ameliorate disease development and progression of patient-reported measures,” advised the authors. They recommended that additional studies assess diagnosis and treatment, along with outcome measures and patient responses, with a focus on development of better clinical tools for monitoring and management.

J Rheumatol. doi: 10.3899/jrheum.171094""Watertown, Mass.-based Selecta Biosciences is eying a Phase III trial for its gout treatment based on expanded positive data from an ongoing mid-stage trial that showed a significant reduction of serum uric acid at 12 weeks. The data was shown off in a poster presentation at the 2018 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Annual European Congress of Rheumatology in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The data is an expansion of data presented at an early conference, the Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology, the company said. The data shows that patients treated with three monthly doses of SEL-212, a combination of rapamycin and pegylated uricase (pegsiticase) which was then followed by two monthly doses of pegsiticase alone, reduced serum uric acid in a significant number of patients. Approximately 81 percent of patients treated had serum uric acid control below 6 mg/dl at week 12, the company said. That’s an improvement over data that was first reported in April that showed 75 percent of SEL-212 patients had reduced serum uric acid levels. With the positive news and plans for a late-stage trial, Selecta is eying a treatment that could potentially challenge Horizon Pharma’s gout treatment Krystexxa. Gout is a form of arthritis that occurs due to the accumulation of urate crystals in the joints. Those crystals form when there are high levels of uric acid in the blood. Additionally, Selecta said SEL-212 has also shown to be a benefit in reducing gout flares in patients. In its report, Selecta said 27 percent of all current patients in the SEL-212 Phase II trial experienced gout flares during the first month after treatment. Selecta said data shows a continued reduction of gout flare rates over months two to five. What makes this important, Selecta said, is the reduced rate of gout flares “appears to be substantially lower than the incidence of gout flares reported in clinical trials involving the current FDA-approved uricase.” SEL-212 is designed to be the first non-immunogenic version of uricase. Werner Cautreels, president and chief executive officer of Selecta, said the company is pleased with the continued improvement in clinical activity. Cautreels said the company believes the expanded data further demonstrates “SEL-212’s potential ability to change the chronic severe gout treatment paradigm” by providing greater reduction in serum uric acid levels and better control of gout flares., particularly as it compares to Krystexxa. “We are now in the fourth treatment cycle of patients receiving five monthly doses of the combination treatment of SEL-212 and plan to report data from those patients at an upcoming medical meeting in the third quarter of this year. Those data have the potential to demonstrate the extended benefit of SEL-212 in chronic severe gout patients with high medical need and position us to execute on our Phase III program, which we plan to start later this year,” Cautreels added. During clinical trials, SEL-212 has been well tolerated, with only 17 serious adverse events (SAEs) reported. Of those, none were reported to not likely be related to the drug and eight were infusion reactions.""Share this content: US study documents a 27% increase in visits to emergency departments for a primary diagnosis of acute gout from 2006 to 2014. Emergency department (ED) visits for gout rose dramatically from 2006 to 2014, especially among individuals aged 45 to 64 years, according to study findings presented at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2018 Annual European Congress of Rheumatology in The Netherlands. During that 9-year period, the number of ED visits for a primary diagnosis of acute gout increased from 168,580 in 2006 to 213,780 in 2014, a 26.8% increase, reported Alka Mithal, MD, of the Institute of Clinical Outcomes Research and Education in Woodside, California, and Gurkipal Singh, MD, adjunct clinical professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine in Stanford, California. The prevalence of ED visits rose from 56.5 per 100,000 population in 2006 to 67 per 100,000 population in 2014. During that same period, individuals aged 45 to 64 years experienced the largest increase in prevalence, jumping from 91 to 116 ED visits per 100,000 population, a 28% increase. Men were responsible 78% of visits in both 2006 and 2014. The dramatic increase in ED visits in the United States among patients with a primary diagnosis of gout over the 9-year period “reflects a sizeable and owing population of patients with gout whose symptoms are not controlled and not well managed,” Dr Gurkipal, the lead study investigator, stated in a press release. “Often the treatment of gout focuses on alleviating the symptoms of painful gout flares. However, when escalating symptoms reach the threshold of an ED visit, this suggest that the underlying accumulation of uric acid may not have been adequately addressed .” Related Articles The results are based on an analysis of data from the Nationwide Emergency Department Sample, the largest all-payer ED data in the United States.

The results from this trial, known as MAVORIC, have already been submitted for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, and were presented here at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2017 Annual Meeting. Mogamulizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CC chemokine receptor 4, which is frequently expressed on leukemic cells of certain hematologic malignancies including CTCL. The drug is already approved in Japan for another rare disease, adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma. In the study, mogamulizumab achieved a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 7.7 months, which is significantly longer than the 3.1 months for those treated with vorinostat ( Zolinza , Merck & Co), which is an FDA-approved standard-of-care treatment for patients with CTCL (hazard ratio, 0.53; P < .0001). ""This is the first report of a randomized phase 3 study evaluating PFS as a primary endpoint in CTCL to compare a new systemic therapy against an FDA-approved agent, utilizing the consensus comprehensive global response criteria,"" said lead author Youn H. Kim, MD, professor of dermatology and director of the Multidisciplinary Cutaneous Lymphoma Program at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California. ""Mogamulizumab demonstrated significantly superior efficacy outcomes compared to vorinostat in patients with previously treated CTCL."" ""This study supports mogamulizumab as a valuable new therapeutic option in patients with CTCL,"" Dr Kim noted. CTCL is a group of lymphoproliferative disorders characterized by localization of neoplastic T lymphocytes to the skin; collectively, CTCL is classified as a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. ""We dont think a lot about CTCL because it is one of the rare forms of lymphoma that we treat,"" commented Laurie Sehn, MD, chair, Lymphoma Tumour Group, BC Cancer Agency, British Columbia, Canada. ""But it is an extremely debilitating type of lymphoma. They have lesions that are highly visible to themselves and others, they are highly symptomatic, and as time goes on, the disease progresses."" She noted that most of the chemotherapy regimens used in other types of lymphomas are not very effective for this subtype. ""We have few effective options, and this is a very morbid condition,"" she commented at a press briefing held during the meeting. ""Doctors and patients are looking forward to more effective therapies, like the one we saw in this study."" New Therapies for CTCL At last years ASH meeting, Dr Kim presented the results for another CTCL therapy. Among patients with CD30 expressing CTCL, treatment with the CD30-targeting antibody brentuximab vedotin ( Adcetris , Seattle Genetics) was superior to physicians choice of therapy (methotrexate or bexarotene) in the phase 3 head-to-head-comparator ALCANZA study. Last month the FDA approved brentuximab vedotin for CTCL patients who have received prior systemic therapy, based on the results of the ALCANZA study. Specifically, it was approved for patients with primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma or CD30-expressing mycosis fungoides, which are the most common subtypes of CTCL. In an earlier US-based phase 1/2 study in CTCL, Dr Youn explained, mogamulizumab demonstrated a tolerable safety profile and promising efficacy, with a 37% overall response rate (ORR) and a 95% response rate. These results led to the development of the current MAVORIC trial, which looked at the efficacy and safety of mogamulizumab vs vorinostat in previously treated patients with CTCL. In August, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation status to mogamulizumab, which is being developed for the treatment of both mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome in adult patients who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. Significantly Improved PFS The MAVORIC Trial was conducted in 59 centers across 11 countries, and randomly assigned 372 patients with mycosis fungoides (stage 1B-IVB) or Sézary syndrome (B2) who had failed one or more systemic therapies to either mogamulizumab 1.0 mg/kg (weekly for the first 4-week cycle and then every 2 weeks) or vorinostat (400 mg daily). Patients randomly assigned to vorinostat had the option of crossing over to the investigational product if they experienced disease progression or intolerable toxicity. The studys primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS in the randomized population, using the global composite response (based on skin, blood, nodes, and viscera) according to the ISCL/EORTC consensus guidelines. Secondary endpoints included ORR, duration of response, and quality of life. The significant improvement in PFS for mogamulizumab vs vorinostat was also seen on independent review (hazard ratio, 0.64; P = .0007; 6.7 vs 3.8 months). Superior PFS was also observed across predefined subgroups. For secondary endpoints, global ORR was also significantly improved in the patients who received mogamulizumab vs vorinostat, at 28.0% vs 4.8% ( P < .0001). This was also true as stratified by disease subtype: In patients with mycosis fungoides, it was 21.0% vs 7.1% ( P = .0042), and for Sézary syndrome, it was 37.0% vs 2.3% ( P < .0001). In addition, an ORR of 30.1% was observed in crossover patients. Time to treatment response was also superior for the investigational agent, with a median of 3.32 vs 5.10 months. The duration of response also favored mogamulizumab, at 14.1 vs 9.1 months. There were also statistically significant differences observed in patient-reported outcomes, as measured by the Skindex-29 and FACT-G, in favor of mogamulizumab, with significantly greater symptom reduction and improved functional status (Skindex-29 Symptoms cycles 3, 5, and 7, P < .05; Functional Cycles 3 and 5, P < .05; FACT-G Functional Well-Being scale cycles 3, 5, 7, and 9, P < .05). The majority of adverse events associated with mogamulizumab were mild to moderate, Dr Kim explained. About 55% were grade 1/2, and 42.4% were grade 3/4. The most common events that were more commonly observed in the mogamulizumab group included infusion-related reactions (33.2% vs 0.5%, respectively) and skin eruptions caused by the drug (23.9% vs 0.5%, respectively). Established as an Effective Option Commenting on the study, Stefan K. Barta, MD, associate professor in the Department of Hematology/Oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, noted that randomized studies for this disease have been rare, and the ""investigators have to be congratulated on completing a randomized prospective clinical trial with 372 patients receiving either oral vorinostat or the new [CC chemokine receptor 4] monoclonal antibody mogalizumab."" ""In this trial, mogalizumab resulted in an approximate doubling in the median [PFS] and a nearly 6-fold improvement in response when compared to vorinostat,"" Dr Barta told Medscape Medical News . ""This was especially [true in] patients with Sézary syndrome, who appeared to derive the greatest benefit with a response seen in 37% of patients as compared to only 2.3% treated with vorinostat."" The drug was also well tolerated, and disease-related symptoms and functional status in mogalizumab-treated patients were significantly improved. ""This establishes mogalizumab as an effective option for patients with mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome who have received at least 1 prior systemic therapy, and especially for CTCL patients with significant blood involvement,"" Dr Barta commented.

Soaring U.S. prices for both branded and generic drugs have sparked public outrage and government investigations over the past few years. ""Drug price increases are somewhat more constrained in 2017 and 2018 than they have been previously,"" Cowen and Co analyst Eric Schmidt said. Allergan Inc raised prices on 18 different drugs, including dry eye treatment Restasis and irritable bowel syndrome drug Linzess, by 9.5 percent, according to a research note released by Jefferies on Tuesday. related news Jefferies cited data collected by Medi-Span Price Rx and refers to list price increases, before potentially significant discounts and rebates that drugmakers provide to win preferred coverage by insurers. Medi-Span did not respond to requests to confirm the data. Allergans chief executive, Brent Saunders, in late 2016 pledged to keep price increases below 10 percent as part of what he called the companys ""Social Contract with Patients."" Allergan spokesman Mark Marmur said the increases will be the only ones taken on those brands in 2018, adding that discounts to various payers should bring the actual increases to consumers down to the low single digits. Other drugmakers raising prices include Amgen Inc , Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc and Horizon Pharma , according to Jefferies and Cowen. Amgen raised the price on its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis drug Enbrel by 9.7 percent and Teva increased prices on its ProAir HFA and ProAir RespiClick asthma inhalers by 6 and 3 percent, respectively. Drug price increases are coming under more scrutiny from states.

Those ingredients can be purchased by patients very cheaply separately. However, Horizon said that Vimovo is a special formulation thats not the same as simply combining the two main ingredients. A Horizon spokesman noted there are no FDA-approved generic, over-the-counter or clinically ""equivalent"" medicines to Vimovo.

In 2015, thanks to an unrestricted grant from Horizon Pharma, IDF set out to create the first website and blog dedicated to news and information regarding Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD), a rare type of primary immunodeficiency disease (PI). Experts in the fields developed the site’s valuable content about CGD, covering diagnosis, treatment and more. To augment that important content, over the past three years, IDF has shared stories about individuals and families learning how to effectively manage CGD and some undergoing curative treatments. We’ve covered topics related to new research of CGD, inspiring hope for future generations. Clinical trials providing stem cell gene therapy for CGD are currently underway. “We appreciate the time and efforts of healthcare professionals, individuals and families from the CGD community who have made LivingwithCGD.org what it is today,” said John G. Boyle, IDF President & CEO. “Since we launched the site, we have helped expand the information available to those facing this disorder and bring the community together,” Hundreds from the CGD community came together for the first Special CGD Symposiums at the IDF National Conferences in 2015 and 2017 and Special CGD Sessions at the IDF Retreats in 2016. Through it all, LivingwithCGD.org has documented these milestones, and we take great pride in being a trusted source of news and information for the CGD community. Tragically, despite the progress that has been made in CGD, the community has also lost precious lives to CGD in the past three years. Given the rarity of the disease and the closeness of patients and families around the world, each child or adult whose life has been cut short fills us with a profound sense of grief. “The fact remains that we want to see cures for CGD and all types of PI,” said Boyle. “To accomplish this goal, we continue to fight alongside each person in our community. Together, we can find hope in learning about innovative research and patient success stories. We can find a way forward by learning how patients and their loved ones can live productive lives with CGD.” In addition, thanks to the useful information and strong sense of community we have created, LivingwithCGD.org, the site is connecting people around the world. “I’ve enjoyed reading about the experiences that families are having with being either a patient or a relative of someone affected by CGD, said Carly Ann Koncuk of Birmingham, England, whose son, Aydin, age 3, had a successful BMT in 2016. “I have commented on many posts to help others in need of advice and support.” Meanwhile, Craig Adams, 41, of Vancouver, BC, Canada, who is a patient with CGD, said he is inspired by success stories of fellow patients who have undergone curative treatments. “For many years I was under the impression that a stem cell transplant was too risky of a procedure, but that was from information from long ago, “ said Adams. “My perception has changed because of this site, and now I am going through the process to take on the life changing procedure!” We are deeply thankful to the CGD community for its positive feedback for helping to expand the site’s reach, touching more patients and families in every part of the globe. As we mark the three-year anniversary, we also wish to express our profound gratitude for the contributions of Harry Malech, Chief, Genetic Immunotherapy Section, National Institutes of Health, who a world-renowned CGD expert who serves as an advisor to the site and coordinates the National Conference Special CGD Symposiums. “‘Living with CGD’ reinforces the IDF’s overall educational mission to support patients,” said Dr. Malech. “We support their efforts to continue to raise awareness for CGD and the primary immunodeficiency community.” Yes, together, we have made great strides, and by continuing to connect with us, sharing your stories, comments, and ideas, we’ll grow stronger still. As always, we encourage you to share your stories and feedback with us!

Data Scientist Job""A New Year often rings in higher drug prices, and many top drugmakers marked the occasion in just that way this year. List price increases hit dozens of drugs, including staple drugs and blockbuster hopefuls. None of the increases, however, topped the 10% price-hike cap that’s been trendy in pharma since 2016. In specialty pharma, Allergan, Teva, Collectis, Insys, Synergy and Supernus all raised prices effective January 1, according to Jefferies analysts. Allergan changed its stickers on 18 medications—all by 9.5%—including key drugs Namenda XR, which treats Alzheimer’s disease; Linzess, which targets irritable bowel syndrome for patients with constipation and chronic idiopathic constipation; and Bystolic, a high blood pressure drug. For its part, Teva hiked prices on seven drugs, with increases ranging from 2.3% to 9.4%. Those hikes come during a turbulent time as it works to cut costs and lay off thousands of employees—and when it needs all the revenue it can get. The hikes were focused on its branded drugs, including respiratory therapy ProAirRespiclick and Parkinson’s therapy Azilect. Horizon Pharma, which has come under fire for past hikes, kept to the single-digit arena with four price increases, all amounting to 9.9%, introduced on Dec. 29. As the companies raised prices for more than 30 drugs to ring in the New Year—but not a single one by more than 9.9%—it’s clear they’re sticking by Allergan CEO Brent Saunders’ “social contract” pricing pledge, introduced back in 2016. During an intense pricing firestorm that year, Saunders said the industry should police itself on pricing or risk regulatory reform. He said his company would limit price hikes to once a year and by single digits, a commitment many fellow drugmakers have followed—and others have adhered to it in a de facto fashion. On Tuesday, an Allergan spokesperson told FiercePharma the “price increases are consistent with Allergan’s Social Contract with Patients—the average list price increase is consistent with our single-digit commitment, and this will be the only price increase taken on these brands in 2018, again, consistent with our commitment.” “Discounts to commercial PBMs, health plans, patients and government payers are expected to bring the net realized price increase down to the low single digits (~2-3%),” he added. Of course, not all drugmakers have chosen to live by the Saunders rule. Celgene recently raised prices on key drugs Revlimid and Pomalyst, with hikes of 19.8% and 17.7% last year, respectively. Between two sets of increases rolled out in January and June last year, Pfizer raised Viagra’s list price by 27.5%, according to a Financial Times report in June. For many years, drug pricing has been a contentious topic for the pharmaceutical sector. Despite public frustration and strong rhetoric in Congress, however, no proposals on the issue have gained steam in Washington, D.C. In response, many states have taken the issue into their own hands, passing legislation focusing on different segments of the drug business. So far, analysts figure not much federal action will come in 2018, and drugmakers may feel more free to roll out higher prices. And even if this January round didn’t top 10%, it’s unclear whether these same drugs will see another round before 2019 rolls around. http://bit.ly/2EENFel""By Ronald Kaplan, PhD, Executive Vice President for Research, Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science In this issue of Catalyst, we highlight new ISTC member Rosalind Franklin University (RFU) and their efforts to accelerate health innovation in Illinois. Rosalind Franklin University (RFU) in North Chicago is a growing hub for basic science and translational research in Illinois. We have grown our federal research funding by 80 percent since 2008 and now, we’re stepping up our investment with the construction of a new, state-of-the-art, Innovation and Research Park. The expansion will serve as a hub for life science research in Lake County, which boasts the highest concentration of pharmaceutical, diagnostic and medical device companies in the Midwest. It will foster collaboration among university and industry scientists and life science entrepreneurs, with the goal of moving our research beyond our laboratories into development, which can improve health and wellness and help grow our local and regional economy. A ceremonial groundbreaking for the park, which will be located on our campus, adjacent to Great Lakes Naval Station and the Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center, two of our many research and clinical partners, was held in September. Preparatory construction begins in October for the 100,000 square foot facility, which will feature cutting-edge wet labs and office, incubation, and meeting space. The project is expected to generate an estimated 500 direct new jobs. A study by Lake County Partners, the county’s principal economic development group, forecasts a total economic regional impact of $117 million per year. Street view architectural rendering of RFU Innovation and Research Park Our research park will serve as a center for life science research and development and will help speed innovation, which largely derives from research-based medical schools. Lake County’s life science industry, which includes manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, medical devices, hospital products, and agricultural and biotech firms in addition to related services, comprises more than 120 companies and 33,000 jobs, according to Lake County Partners. Companies include Abbvie, Abbott Labs, Baxter, Takeda, Shire, Lundbeck, Horizon Pharma, Fresenius Kabi, Omron and Valent Bioscience (Sumitomo). The Innovation and Research Park will house 175 university and industry researchers with approximately 34,000 square feet of space designated for commercial startups and small to mid-size biotech firms. RFU is in discussions with several industry partners about prospective collaborations and international companies looking to expand to the United States. We’re working with the SmartHealth Activator, a Lake County-based incubator focused on the commercialization of biotechnology coming out of Midwest universities, to increase the number of new companies formed by RFU faculty entrepreneurs. One of the most, NeuroLucent, was named “Best University Startup” in 2016 by the National Council of Entrepreneurial Tech Transfer — the only Illinois-based firm selected for the honor. Founded by RFU neuroscientist Grace “Beth” Stutzmann, the company is working to move promising new therapeutics for Alzheimer’s disease into the pharmaceutical pipeline, including a compound that could yield the first medication to effectively treat AD’s most devastating symptoms. RFU faculty startups are also working to translate medical discoveries into improved therapeutics and diagnostics for cancer and fibrotic disease, stroke, cardiac resuscitation and vaccine delivery. Our many NIH-funded scientists conduct biomedical research in 12 major areas, including drug discovery and development, cystic fibrosis, stem cell and regenerative medicine, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and traumatic brain injury. Rosalind Franklin University’s is committed to health innovation in our state and nation. Our new Innovation and Research Park, and our membership in the Illinois Science & Technology Coalition, are evidence of that commitment. Working in collaboration with with Lake County’s corporate community and life science industry, while also cultivating our own culture of entrepreneurship, we can put our science to work to improve health and save lives.

Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), the No. 4 Democrat in the House, to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the primary on Tuesday is being felt on K Street this morning. “For me, personally, it’s losing a mentor and a best friend,” said Mervyn Jones, a lobbyist at Pine Street Strategies and a former Crowley staffer. Crowley had a great relationship with K Street, Jones said, and had a reputation for being upfront with lobbyists. “He would just tell you flat out why he wouldn’t be able to support what you were lobbying for,” Jones said. Story Continued Below — There are a number of former Crowley staffers downtown, the most prominent of whom might be Chris McCannell, a former chief of staff to Crowley who now represents clients including Paypal and the U.S. Travel Association as a lobbyist for the Eris Group. Others include Gregg Sheiowitz, a former legislative director for Crowley who now lobbies for Zurich North America; Eli Kogan, a former senior legislative assistant who’s now a lobbyist for Horizon Pharma; and Grisella Martinez, a former special adviser to Crowley who now lobbies for the National Association of Broadcasters. — Crowley’s current staffers will have to find new jobs next year, of course. But Ivan Adler, a headhunter who specializes in placing people on K Street, said Crowley’s loss shouldn’t affect their ability to get hired if they decide to become lobbyists. Given Crowley’s position as Democratic caucus chairman and his spot on the House Ways and Means Committee, his staffers “are very well-connected and really shouldn’t suffer too much from losing their rabbi,” Adler said. Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Tips: mlevine@politico.com and tmeyer@politico.com. You can also follow us on Twitter: @theodoricmeyer and @marianne_levine. NCTA LOBBYIST LEAPS TO BGR: Justin Rzepka, a vice president of government relations at NCTA — The Internet & Television Association, is joining BGR Group as a vice president. He’s a Republican and will focus on technology and telecommunications issues. Bob Wood, the president of BGR Government Affairs, told PI last week that the firm was expanding its commerce practice. NFL HIRES S-3: The National Football League has added S-3 Group to its roster of lobbying firms. Todd Wooten, John Scofield, Kate Dickens and Matt Bravo will lobby on sports gambling for the league, according to a disclosure filing. The NFL, which shelled out $300,000 on Washington lobbying in the first quarter of the year, also retains Capitol Counsel, Covington & Burling, the Glover Park Group and Thorn Run Partners. The National Football League Players Association, meanwhile, retains Fierce Government Relations and Forbes Tate Partners. HANGING A SHINGLE: Former Senate Finance Committee staffer Scott Mulhauser is launching his own strategic advisory and communications firm, Aperture Strategies. Mulhauser helped run the Senate Finance Committee while former Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.) was chairman. He also served as deputy chief of staff to Vice President Joe Biden during the 2012 campaign and as chief of staff at the U.S. embassy in Beijing during Baucus’ tenure as ambassador to China. TWITTER AND FACEBOOK QUIETLY WOOING REPUBLICANS: “Twitter and Facebook are scrambling to assuage conservative leaders who have sounded alarms — and sought to rile voters — with accusations that the country’s tech giants are censoring right-leaning posts, tweets and news,” The Washington Post’s Tony Romm reports. “From secret dinners with conservative media elite to private meetings with the Republican National Committee, the new outreach reflects tech giants’ delicate task: satisfying a party in power while defending online platforms against attacks that threaten to undermine the public’s trust in the web.” — More detail on that secret dinner: “Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, convened a rare private dinner with Republican leaders and conservative commentators in Washington last week at Cafe Milano, a familiar Georgetown haunt for city power brokers, according to four people who participated in the dinner but requested anonymity because it was off the record. … Among those attending the June 19 dinner were Mercedes Schlapp, a top communications advisor for President Trump; Grover Norquist, the leader of Americans for Tax Reform; Greta Van Susteren, a right-leaning host on MSNBC; and Guy Benson, a Fox News commentator, according to the people in the room.” Full story. SENATORS CONSIDER NEW RESTRICTIONS ON SHAREHOLDER POWER AFTER YEARS OF LOBBYING: “Republicans will suspend their crusade to roll back financial regulations on Thursday as the Senate Banking Committee considers imposing new government oversight on businesses that are key to the surge in socially conscious investing,” POLITICO’s Patrick Temple-West reports. “After years of lobbying by pro-business groups, lawmakers will weigh whether to require the firms that advise shareholders on how to press issues such as environmentalism and executive pay to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That could saddle the firms with costly reporting requirements.” Full story. IF YOU MISSED IT: “Everett Eissenstat, a senior White House official who represented President Donald Trump at major international meetings, including this month’s dramatic G-7 summit in Canada, is leaving the administration next month,” POLITICO’s Andrew Restuccia reports. “Eissenstat, a former top aide to Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), joined the administration last year for a joint appointment on the National Economic Council and the National Security Council, where he focused on international economic affairs. … Eissenstat has been quietly looking for jobs in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the issue. He has spoken to a number of companies and firms, including [General Motors], but has not made a final decision about his next steps.” Full story. JOBS REPORT — Monument Policy Group has added Melanie Lehnhardt as a legislative and public affairs manager. She was previously a legislative assistant for Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). Monument also promoted Kevin Stutman to legislative and public affairs manager. He was previously a fellow at the firm.

Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), the No. 4 Democrat in the House, to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the primary on Tuesday is being felt on K Street this morning. “For me, personally, it’s losing a mentor and a best friend,” said Mervyn Jones, a lobbyist at Pine Street Strategies and a former Crowley staffer. Crowley had a great relationship with K Street, Jones said, and had a reputation for being upfront with lobbyists. “He would just tell you flat out why he wouldn’t be able to support what you were lobbying for,” Jones said. — There are a number of former Crowley staffers downtown, the most prominent of whom might be Chris McCannell, a former chief of staff to Crowley who now represents clients including Paypal and the U.S. Association as a lobbyist for the Eris Group. Others include Gregg Sheiowitz, a former legislative director for Crowley who now lobbies for Zurich North America; Eli Kogan, a former senior legislative assistant who’s now a lobbyist for Horizon Pharma; and Grisella Martinez, a former special adviser to Crowley who now lobbies for the National Association of Broadcasters. — Crowley’s current staffers will have to find new jobs next year, of course. But Ivan Adler, a headhunter who specializes in placing people on K Street, said Crowley’s loss shouldn’t affect their ability to get hired if they decide to become lobbyists. Given Crowley’s position as Democratic caucus chairman and his spot on the House Ways and Means Committee, his staffers “are very well-connected and really shouldn’t suffer too much from losing their rabbi,” Adler said.

That’s the view of a prominent writer and activist, Elisabeth Rosenthal, who spoke last week at the Bankhead Theater in Livermore. Her talk was part of the Rae Dorough Speaker Series. Rosenthal told the audience that while there is no single, simple solution to the problem, all of us can contribute to improvements by taking personal actions like insisting on being treated only by medical professionals within our own insurance networks and by asking doctors to find low-cost laboratories for blood tests. Rosenthal is a Harvard-trained physician who spent more than two decades writing health-related articles for the New York Times and other national publications. Today, she is executive editor of Kaiser Health News, a nonprofit, Washington-based news service that is part of the Kaiser Family Foundation and not affiliated with the Kaiser Permanente medical care system. Early this year, she published An American Sickness, a book that details the evolution of the American healthcare system from a small, experimental health insurance program in Texas more than a century ago to today’s healthcare giants, focused on profit more than on health. The theme of both her book and her talk was summarized in the opening sentences of the book’s introduction: “In the past quarter century, the American medical system has stopped focusing on health or even science. Instead it attends more or less single-mindedly to its own profits.” The book included some of the thousands of stories of skyrocketing drug prices and unaffordable medical bills that she accumulated in her medical reporting. The stories came from doctors as well as patients. She described them to the Bankhead audience as “a litany of all the ways in which American healthcare is failing patients today.” As if on cue, as the Independent was going to press with this article, the Washington Post reported on the drug daranide, prescribed for a rare genetic illness called periodic paralysis, whose price rose from $50 for a bottle of 100 pills to $15,000 after a company called Strongbridge Pharma acquired it. That was not one of Rosenthal’s stories, but she told others like it. There was the German visitor who was billed $10,000 for trauma team activation after being seen at San Francisco General Hospital for minor injuries suffered while bicycling. There was a New York City high school teacher with severe autoimmune disease who could not function without a medical infusion costing $19,000. When his physician moved to a different hospital a few blocks away, he moved his infusion treatments there and discovered that the same procedure now cost $110,000. There was a Houston city worker who complained about the high cost of a prescription drug called Duexis, which is simply a combination of two common nonprescription drugs, the painkiller ibuprofen (often sold as Advil or Motrin) and stomach-soothing famotidine (sold as Pepcid.) Rosenthal estimated the monthly cost of the easily available ingredients at $11, but the small drug company Horizon Pharma obtained needed patents, got FDA approval and was selling the drug at $1,600 per month. In many of these cases, Rosenthal said, insurance companies cover some if not all of the cost, so the patient may feel relieved. That’s understandable, she said, but people should speak up. “Too many of us open the bill, find something that doesn’t seem right (but) our out-of-pocket response isn’t that high so we think we have dodged a bullet. “It’s really important that we speak out on these issues. ‘If you see something, say something,’” she said, mimicking the national anti-terrorism slogan in the context of healthcare economy. The extreme prices contribute to radical inflation, she pointed out. In some cases, the insurance companies may simply be paying because other companies are doing so, and they don’t want to lose business from major medical providers. Costs rise because of the counterintuitive practice of “sticky pricing,” she said. Where there are competing companies, we would expect one company to promote its lower prices for greater sales if another company raised its prices dramatically. In healthcare, however, it seems that if one pharmaceutical company raises its drug price tenfold, another company will do the same. Rosenthal herself was the daughter of a physician. When she entered medical training, moved on to medical practice and later to journalism, she took it for granted that U.S. healthcare was focused on patient care. By the time she wrote her book, she told the Bankhead audience, “I felt like I didn’t understand… I didn’t understand how, in my lifetime… American medicine has gotten so out of whack.” As she wrote the book, she realized, “What has happened over the past 25 years of my lifetime is a gradual shift of focus from patient-centered, evidence-based care to a business. Healthcare has been slowly hijacked or diverted by business interests.” She emphasized that she is not opposed to all profits in healthcare. She did say, however, that the values of businesses – “their return on investment, their efficiency, their profits — are not the values of healthcare. “I think those (profit-focused business values) have gotten on the front burner while caring and curing and treating are on the back burner.” She had several recommendations for patients to reduce the risk of surprise bills and overpricing and to combat medical cost inflation. For one, she said, beware of ambulances, which in the U.S are increasingly “run by venture capital companies because they are good business; they charge and they are not in the network in many cities anymore.” For another, ask your physician to have blood tests done at commercial labs that operate inexpensively. A blood test sent to a hospital may cost literally 20 times what it costs in a commercial lab. She advises asking the doctor to look into the comparative costs of local radiologists to be able to order any necessary X-rays at a reasonable cost. “I think it’s every physician’s responsibility to know…To say to the guy who is charging $1,000 rather than $100, I’m not going to send my patients to you anymore because you’re ripping them off. A lot of them have high deductible plans and they’re paying for this.” She advises people facing hospital stays to insist that they not be treated by anyone outside their insurance network. “When you get that form that says you agree to pay for your care, I always tell people to write in, ‘So long as it’s in my insurance network.’ “My goal in a hospital is to make sure that everyone who touches me while I’m there is in my insurance network.” She said the problem of receiving surprise out-of-network bills does not generally occur with Kaiser Permanente, which is a unified system. “However, that is not generally true in the rest of the country.” She also thinks it is important for hospitals to publish the services and costs that patients may encounter: the so-called “Chargemaster” list. Californians are fortunate to live in the only state that requires Chargemaster publication, she said. Under a 2003 state law, sometimes called the Payer’s Bill of Rights, every California hospital must make the list public.

The reason? Avexis’ innovative research into gene therapy, including one promising treatment for spinal muscular atrophy or SMA, the number one genetic cause of death for infants. Novartis paid an 88 percent premium for the deal, or $218 per share, because it saw AveXis’ research as an important part of Novartis’ goal of becoming a global leader in treating neurodegenerative diseases.

Urea cycle includes a sequence of biochemical steps in which one of the waste products of protein metabolism (nitrogen) in blood is removed and progressively converted into a compound called urea. In end, urea in the blood is removed the body as urine. In UCD, nitrogen amasses in the form of ammonia, which is a highly poisonous substance for the body. It results into a precarious condition called hyperammonia (elevated levels of ammonia in blood). If the ammonia enters the brain cells via blood, it can lead to coma, irremediable brain damage, or in serious condition death. Download PDF Brochure of Report: https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=B&rep_id=39329 According to reports published by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), the anticipated incidence of UCD is 1 in 8500 births. Research findings suggest that many of the cases of UCD persist undiagnosed. In some of the cases, the newborn with UCD dies without a conclusive diagnosis. The precise global incidence of such cases is underrated or unknown. Some of the scientists in Europe suggest that Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) cases might be due to an unknown inborn error of metabolism, for example, UCD. These scenarios are anticipated to drive the urea cycle disorders treatment market in the next few years. Additionally, research & development initiatives undertaken by research & academic institutes supported by pharmaceutical companies as well as governments are estimated to drive the global urea cycle disorders treatment market. Consequently, want of diagnosis & treatment options, unavailability of skilled personnel, and lack of reimbursement policies in developing countries are some of the factors hindering the growth of global urea cycle disorders treatment market. The UCD treatment market is less competitive as compared to other markets as UCD is a rare disorder and no conclusive research regarding it has been conducted so far. Government and pharmaceutical companies need to create awareness in the market and collaborative approaches should be undertaken. The global urea cycle disorders treatment market can be divided based on type of treatment, enzyme deficiency type, delivery channels, and region. On the basis of treatment type, the global urea cycle disorders treatment market can be classified into amino acid formulas, phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate, and others.

But which drugs actually cost the most? Here are the 11 most expensive outpatient drugs, as of May 2018, based on list prices for a typical one-month prescription. The 11 drugs on this list are all priced well over $25,000 for a monthly supply, and treat diseases rare diseases that afflict few people in the US. Prices are based on the Wholesale Aquisition Cost (WAC), also referred to as a drug’s list price. This is the price the pharmaceutical company assigns as an official price to a drug, though actual costs to the patient may vary. While few people actually pay out of pocket for these drugs, as they are typically shielded by their health insurance, every year more people are on the hook for the price of their drug due to high deductible insurance plans and formulary changes. And high-priced drugs end up raising insurance rates and overall healthcare spending. 11 Most Expensive Drugs in the US Drug List Price Actimmune $52,321 Daraprim $45,000 Cinryze $44,140 Chenodal $42,570 Myalept $42,137 H.P. Acthar $38,892 Juxtapid $36,992 Firazyr $32,468 Harvoni $31,500 Cuprimine $31,426 Sovaldi $28,000 1. Actimmune – $52,321 Approved for osteoporosis and chronic granulomatous disease, a rare disorder that causes the immune system to malfunction, Actimmune is manufactured by Horizon Pharma. Patients typically take Actimmune three times a week, and on average will go through about 12 single-use vials a month at $4,360 per vial. 2. Daraprim – $45,000 You might recall 2015 when Martin Shkreli sparked outrage for hiking the price of Daraprim from $13.50 per pill to about $750 per pill in a matter of days. While this caused a national conversation about drug prices and a class-action lawsuit, the price for Daraprim has still remained high – with the list price for a one month supply (60 tablets) coming out to $45,000. Daraprim is commonly given to AIDS and transplant patients to prevent infection and is used to treat toxoplasmosis in otherwise healthy peo0ple. Unlike other drugs on this list, patients are rarely on Dariprim for more than a couple of months. 3. Cinryze – $44,140 Manufactured by Shire, the list price for a typical one month supply (16 vials) of Cinryze runs at $44,140. Cinryze is used to treat hereditary angioedema, a rare life-threatening genetic condition that causes swelling in various parts of the body including hands, face and throat. 4. Chenodal – $42,570 Chenodal, used to dissolve gallstones, is manufactured by Retrophin, which was founded by Martin Shkreli – the same person responsible for Daraprim’s price hike. Back in 2014, while Schreli was still CEO of Retrophin, prices for Chenodiol increased five-fold. What’s more, Chenodal is currently off patent, which means it is technically legal for affordable generics to be manufactured. However, Chenodal is protected under what is referred to as a “closed distribution system,” which prevents generic drug makers from purchasing a brand name drug. While many patients take 90 tablets per month, some can take as many as 210 tablets per month, at a whopping $473 per tablet. 5. Myalept – $42,137 Myalept is an orphan drug used to treat leptin deficiency in patients with generalized lipodystrophy. Myalept is self-administered once-daily, and patients typically use 10 vials per month, at $4,213 per vial. Since Mylapet is the only option to control this rare condition there are no other cost-saving options available. 6. H.P. Acthar – $38,892 H.P. Acthar, also referred to as Acthar, is used to treat multiple conditions like Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, infantile spasms, ophthalmic conditions, psoriatic arthritis and more. It is manufactured by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals and was approved back in 2010. Patients usually use one vial per month, which is priced at $38,892. Just like many drugs on this list, Acthar has also seen its fair share of price hikes. Back in 2001, when Acthar was still manufactured by Sanofi, the list price for one vial ran at about $40. 17 years, and 1 new manufacturer later, the list price for one vial of Acthar runs at $38,892. 7. Juxtapid – $36,992 Juxtapid is manufactured by Aegerion Pharmaceuticals to treat people with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a gene mutation that leads to cardiovascular disease. Patients typically take 28 capsules of Juxtapid per month with a list price of $1,321 per capsule. 8. Firazyr – $32,468.40 Just like Cinryze mentioned above, Firazyr is manufactured by Shire for hereditary angioedema. However, unlike Cinryze, which is used to prevent swelling before an attack, Firazyr is used after an attack. Since patients suffer an average of two to four attacks per month, most fill one carton (3 syringes) of Fyrazar every month at a list price of $32,468. 9. Harvoni – $31,500 Harvoni is manufactured by Gilead and is the first once-daily combination drug used to treat Hepatitis C (HCV). Treatments for Hepatitis C are notoriously expensive, and the cost for Harvoni is no different. Patients typically take Harvoni for 12 weeks, and a one-month supply runs at $31,500 for 28 tablets – $1,125 per tablet. 10. Cuprimine – $31,426 Cuprimine is the oldest drug on this list and has been around since the 1970s. Manufactured by Valeant, Cuprimine removes copper build-up caused by Wilson’s Disease. Patients take one capsule of Cuprimine after every meal. With a list price of $261.89 per tablet, the cost of treatment quickly adds up. Cuprimine’s price has been a hot-button issue and has even sparked debate in Congress and inspired an episode in a Netflix show Dirty Money. 11. Sovaldi – $28,000 Like Harvoni, Sovaldi is manufactured by Gilead to treat Hepatitis C. Patients take Sovaldi for 12 weeks; the fair price for a one month supply runs at $28,000.00 – $1,000 per tablet. How did we get these prices? First, we created a list of the most expensive drugs by list price and excluded drugs that are administered under supervision of a health care provider. Then we obtained typical fill quantities using our data and information from the drug manufacturer websites, to compare the monthly price of these drugs. Using the official manufacturer list price we calculated the total cost of a 1 month supply of a typical fill quantity. For drugs where there is a large effective dosing range, or where patient weight determines dosing, we select a conservative dosing quantity.

(Why?) Source link""As part of National Nurses Week, Minority Nurse is exploring the many paths nurses take to find a career where they feel like they are making an impact. Irma Teune, BSN RN MSCN CCM is a bilingual clinical nurse educator with Horizon Pharma where she educates patients and families about chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a rare primary immunodeficiency disease in which the body is especially susceptible to infections from bacteria and fungi. As frightening as it is to learn you or a loved one has CGD, it can be even more difficult to understand when your primary language is different from that of your medical team. Teune’s ability to speak comfortably in Spanish and English means she can put her patients at ease while giving them the exact information and guidance they need to manage the disease. Minority Nurse asked Teune some questions about her career path and how she is making a difference as a nurse. 1. How did you discover the field of nursing was right for you? Like most people who pursue a nursing career, my primary passion is helping people living with chronic illness – and for me, my sister inspired this desire in me. When I was 27 years old, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. It was an overwhelming time for our whole family – I received many questions from my family and her husband concerning her diagnosis and treatment since I was a registered nurse. The more I became involved with my sister’s health, the more I understood the perspective of family members of people with chronic diseases, and how the lives of caregivers are often just as impacted as the patients. I recognized the effect a caring, understanding nurse could have on patients, as well as their families, by playing that role within my own. I wanted to be part of that positive impact for patients and their families! 2. What led you to becoming a clinical nurse educator? I first became a CNE for an MS therapy – because for me, it really was personal. I was very knowledgeable in MS diagnosis and treatment, so it was a natural fit for me to move into this role. After about six years, I was looking for a change and pursued an opportunity with Horizon Pharma. I’m now part of a support program for people who are prescribed Horizon’s therapy for chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a primary immunodeficiency that only 20 children are diagnosed with in the U.S. each year. For families impacted by this rare disease, it can be difficult to find a healthcare provider that is familiar with the disease, which only increases their fears. And their fears usually stem from not knowing what to expect next or how to manage the condition. That is why educating these patients and their families about CGD is so rewarding for me – it’s the first step to helping them become confident in handling any challenges that may come their way. I not only help patients manage their treatment plan, but also ease some of the burden that comes with being a caregiver. For example, my patients and their families can contact me with any issue—whether it is an insurance question, or a concern about the patient’s health, I will look into the matter and connect them with the right resources. I love it. 3. As our global community becomes increasingly smaller, many people may receive treatment in a place where they do not speak the primary language. How does that barrier impact everything from their ability to decipher a care plan to their hope for a good outcome? How is that magnified when the diagnosis is complex or a rare disease? For any patient, it can be difficult to understand the complexities of their health and the healthcare system, as well as find the resources to support the best possible outcomes. These issues are further complicated when you are not a native speaker of the language of where you are being treated, as clinical details and context can get lost across multiple channels of communication. Language barriers also inhibit the trusting and positive relationship between the patient and provider that is so important for effective treatment. For patients with a rare disease like CGD, because the affected community is so small, basic information is relatively limited – even in English. That’s why it’s so helpful for patients to have someone in their life who can talk knowledgeably about their disease in their language. Speaking to someone in his or her own language breaks down the walls that surround them and helps minimize the barriers they face in accessing and understanding their therapy. Even better – it provides them assurance and confidence that everything is going to be okay. 4. As a bilingual CNE, how do your experiences with patients help elevate the work you do? How does it help the patient and the families who are affected by diseases? As a bilingual CNE, the obvious benefit is that I can communicate with Spanish-language patients in their native language. This helps ensure they are able to successfully adhere to their treatment plan. Additionally, I can help identify issues related to a patient’s or caregiver’s cultural needs. With the trust I’m able to build with my patients and families, they’re able to fully express questions or concerns, and I can ascertain their level of comfort and comprehension in managing their condition, avoiding further difficulties down the road. Most importantly, I can be more effective in giving patients and families the reassurance they need. Imagine a patient or family member is worried about their treatment coverage or health, and hears, “Hola, como estas,” when they reach out for help. Or, when I give a patient the confirmation that everything is going to be okay, “Todo saldrá bien.” It’s these nuances that can make all the difference for a patient’s or caregiver’s treatment experience. And I love bringing this insight and experience to my broader CNE team. My colleagues and I work so closely that to be able to share the experiences of our bilingual patients feels like an honor. 5. What gives you the greatest joy as a nurse and what is your greatest challenge as a nurse? As a Horizon CNE, I support my patients for as long as they are taking CGD medication, which for many, can be for life. Even when patients do feel confident with their treatment plan, or when children gain more independence, I am always available for help and to answer any questions. One of the most rewarding parts of my job is seeing a patient grow, and not just in their disease management. CNEs often play a role for every important milestone, from a child’s first day of school to teaching a college student how to inject their medication on their own. We get to know our patients on a more personal level, and are able to share in their accomplishments and joys as well. Rare diseases can be difficult for even the most experienced doctors to diagnose. Likewise, with CGD, it can be confused with other inflammatory or infectious diseases, as they share many of the same symptoms (such as fever, tiredness, abdominal pain, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, etc.) Unfortunately, by the time these patients are correctly diagnosed, they are often exhausted and scared. Sometimes patients and their families feel dismissed by the healthcare provider’s inexperience in CGD to be able to recognize the condition or its severity. As a result, when I reach out to a new family, they may be wary or tired of their journey and not being heard by the clinical community. As I only work with CGD patients, the condition is basically my whole life; I work hard to assure these families that I understand and can validate their struggles, and that I will help them in any way that they need me. 6. If others are thinking of a career as a CNE, what kinds of education, experience, and expectations might they have? As a CNE, you need to be just as passionate about educating patients and their families as you are about listening to them. For most people living with a rare disease, the journey to diagnosis can be long, arduous and lonely. Some patients dive into research when they are diagnosed, and others take more time to process everything, so I always let them share what they are going through to determine how I can best educate them. It’s important to allow patients to share their thoughts and feelings, and to hold their hand through the experience and acceptance of their condition. It’s this openness and transparency that is so critical to improving treatment outcomes, and helping patients get the most out of the services I can provide. 7. What will you reflect on during National Nurses Week? This National Nurses Week, I will be reflecting on how rewarding it is to watch patients and caregivers develop from uncertain newcomers to advocates for the rare disease community. While I only work with the same 50 or so patients, I know that the impact I have on their families’ lives is far-reaching. For example, I recently met with a young man who is preparing to go to college to teach him how to inject and responsibly take care of his medication, helping him gain more independence. Additionally, one of my newer patients is a six-month-old child. I met with the child’s grandparents and guardian, who were understandably very nervous and worried for the child’s well-being. Seeing them more positive and hopeful at the end of my education session reminded me again of why I love what I do. Reflecting on my patients’ successes and growth fills me with pride, and reminds me of my own accomplishments in my career.

TED, also known as Graves’ opthalmopathy or orbitopathy, is a rare condition in which the eye muscles and fatty tissue behind the eye become inflamed. This can cause proptosis, where the eyes are pushed forward (resulting in “staring” or “bulging” eyes), and the eyes and eyelids become red and swollen. In certain cases, swelling and stiffness of the muscles occur, shifting the eyes so they are no longer in line with each other and/or unable to close. The teprotumumab antibody works by targeting the Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Receptor (IGF-1R), a well-validated target. “Thyroid eye disease can be an incapacitating disease, having a significant effect on a patient’s daily quality of life,” said Gustavo Mahler, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of AGC Biologics. “We’re proud to partner with Horizon Pharma in the manufacturing of teprotumumab, a potentially life-changing therapy.” The post AGC Biologics Enters into Commercial Manufacturing Agreement with Horizon Pharma plc appeared first on Pharma Journalist.""Cystinosis is a rare disease and characterized by accumulation of cystine (a building block of proteins) inside cells. Increase in cystine damages cells and frequently forms crystals that can develop and cause issues in numerous organs and tissues. The kidneys and eyes are particularly defenseless to the damage. Muscles, thyroid, pancreas, and testicles could also be affected. Nephropathic cystinosis, intermediate cystinosis, and non-nephropathic cystinosis are the three types of cystinosis. Cystinosis disease can effect both adults and children. However, the prevalence is high in children. Juvenile nephropathic cystinosis is the most common and serious type of cystinosis disease. In cystinosis disease, a large amount of salts and glucose, bicarbonate, phosphate, potassium, and certain amino acid being excreted through the urine. This is one of the major complications of cystinosis infection (failure of kidneys) in children. In adults, cystine generally accumulates in the cornea of the eyes. Symptoms of cystinosis disease includes dehydration, vomiting, metabolic acidosis, constipation, and polyuria. View Report- https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/cystinosis-disease-therapeutics-market.html Based on treatment type, the global cystinosis disease therapeutics market can be segmented into symptomatic therapy, renal replacement therapy, and hormonal therapy. The symptomatic therapy segment is likely to expand at a rapid pace during the forecast period. The symptomatic therapy is the maintenance of fluid, electrolyte balance in the body. So, most of the doctors prefer to give dose of potassium, sodium, and phosphate substantially in addition with cystine deleting agents like Cysteamine which effectively lowers the cystine content in the cells of a patients with in short time and retain the body fluid. Moreover, the symptomatic therapy is cost effective than the other type of therapy, for this reason the symptomatic therapy segment is expected to grow at a significant pace during the forecast period. In terms of test type, the market can be classified into blood test, molecular test, urine test, slit lamp examination, and others. The blood test segment is likely to expand at a rapid pace during the forecast period.

Cystinosis, especially nephropathic cystinosis, is likely to affect many people in the U.S. Moreover, adoption of different types of therapy to cure cystinosis is expected to augment the cystinosis disease therapeutics market in North America. Europe is also a lucrative market for cystinosis disease therapeutics. Increase in demand for treatment and rise in patient awareness about different treatment options are anticipated to fuel the growth of the cystinosis disease therapeutics market in Europe. The cystinosis disease therapeutics market is Asia Pacific is projected to be driven by increase in population, better treatment options, and rise in demand for rapid diagnosis. Latin America and Middle East & Africa are expected to be moderate contributors to the global cystinosis disease therapeutics market.

But this money will go to clinical studies, case management, social work — a whole host of things that normally you can’t always afford to run in a pediatric children’s hospital. “At the RDI, our goal is to build a network of centers of excellence that we’re helping support and coordinate. These two donations will go a long way towards making it a long-term, stable program,” Summar added. Marshall Summar, MD, is the director of Children’s National’s Rare Disease Institute. (Photo courtesy Children’s National) The Retrophin Rare Disease Network, whose creation was announced in early January, will advance the institute’s efforts to create a global “hub and spoke” model for disseminating and streamlining patient access to optimal care methods among U.S. and foreign peer institutions. The network aims to enhance the field of rare disease medicine by standardizing care models and establishing best practices in diagnosis and treatment. RDI is a first-of-its-kind center focused exclusively on treating both children and adults with rare genetic diseases that remain largely unknown to the general medical community. It is also the first Center of Excellence established by the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD). The institute launched its partnership with NORD in 2017. Children’s National aims to be the first of many of such centers across the United States treating patients with rare diseases, regardless of age. “Retrophin is proud to support the important work that the Children’s National Rare Disease Institute is doing to advance the care and treatment of rare diseases,” Stephen Aselage, CEO of San Diego-based Retrophin, which specializes in rare disease treatments, said in a company press release. “The tremendous difficulty that patients with rare diseases have in getting an accurate diagnosis and early treatment is well-documented. The creation of this network is critical to broadening access to the institute’s innovative resources and programs, and will ultimately lead to expanded specialized care for patients and families in the rare disease community,” Aselage added. Likewise, the Horizon Pharma Clinical Care Endowment — to be given over six years — will fund an expert care team at Children’s National consisting of a clinical geneticists and others, such as genetic counselors, nutritionists and social workers, all specializing in the care of children with rare diseases. “We consistently hear stories from people who spent many years in search of a diagnosis, followed by more years searching for the right team of specialists – suffering through a painful journey with devastating consequences,” said Timothy Walbert, chairman, president and CEO of Horizon, in a company press release. “Our hope is that the Horizon Pharma Clinical Care Endowment and the institute will disrupt this all-too-familiar rare disease trajectory by joining exceptional rare disease specialists together in one place,” he added. Any disease, illness or disorder that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States is considered to be rare, according to the National Institutes of Health. Yet, of the more than 7,000 rare diseases known to exist, fewer than 500 — roughly 5 percent — have a known treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. About one in 10 Americans have a rare disease – approximately 80 percent of which are genetically based. The NIH says more than 80 percent are childhood diseases, and more than a quarter of all children admitted to pediatric hospitals have a rare disease. “We’re working to stabilize the clinical ecosystem in rare diseases, so that physicians have the support they need and patients have a predictable place to come,” Summar told BioNews. “One of the real benefits for them is that diagnoses will be more predictable. And as we roll out the centers of excellence model, it will become multiple but consistent standards.” To date, Children’s National has spent between $10 million and $15 million to refurbish its new clinical and research home at the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center along Georgia Avenue in northwest Washington. The 12-acre property, which was vacated in 2011, includes the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology building, a large parking lot, and a 300-seat lecture hall. The project currently occupies about 12,000 square feet, and will eventually expand to 22,000 square feet, Summar said, estimating its total cost at around $200 million. RDI currently operates out of Children’s National itself. Summar said he expects to be operating at the new location by this fall.

After a while, people get numb to it,” said Adams Dudley, a pulmonologist and director of the University of California, San Francisco’s Center for Healthcare Value. Indeed, both Valeant and Teva have weathered these controversies before — just not in advance of an actual price hike.” Sam Baker, March 21, 2018: “But the pharmaceutical industry hasn’t changed its ways since Trump took office: 20 drugs have seen price hikes of 200% or more since January 2017 …These increases, which can be found in an analysis by Pharmacy Benefits Consultants, are in the drugs’ list prices, before rebates and discounts are applied. People with insurance don’t pay these full amounts, but price hikes still affect everyone.” Robert King, March 13, 2018: “But several experts and advocacy groups say policies in the administration’s latest budget proposal don’t tackle the biggest driver of high prices: Nothing prevents a drugmaker from setting a price at whatever level it wants.” Max Nisen, March 9, 2018: “And price hikes continue for already expensive newer drugs …Drugmakers like to say prices keep rising because pharmacy benefit managers demand ever-bigger discounts for their clients, forcing drugmakers to raise list prices to keep up. But…drug companies do plenty of price-hiking for drugs such as Revlimid that aren’t really discounted.” Meg Tirrell, March 9, 2018: “But large increases still happen. Last month alone, Wells Fargo analyst David Maris tracked the 50 biggest price increases on medicines, the largest of which was a 948.4 percent increase on a drug from Torrent Pharmaceuticals. And data from Rx Savings Solutions show price increases of less than 10 percent on expensive medicines can result in adding thousands of dollars to their cost.” Danny Hakim, January 6, 2018: “A more typical play for drug companies — the Humira play — is to start at a high price and keep raising it ever higher, but incrementally …AbbVie joined a few of its rivals in saying it would limit price increases to single digits this year, and so only raised Humira by another 9.7 percent this month, roughly four and a half times the inflation rate. For the drug industry, that counts as generosity.” Sarah Karlin Smith, January 3, 2018: “NEW YEAR, NEW PRICE HIKES — Drug companies began the new year the way they often do — raising the cost of old drugs …Allergan raised the list prices of more than a dozen meds by 9.5 percent, Jefferies Financial Analyst reported. Insys raised the price of two drugs the same amount, while Horizon Pharma increased the costs of four drugs by 9.9 percent. Other companies that hiked at least one drug by 9 percent or more included Collegium Pharmaceutical, Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Teva and Supernus Pharmaceuticals, per Jefferies.” Leigh Purvis and Dr. Stephen Schondelmeyer, December 2017: “Retail prices for widely used prescription drugs increased, on average, between 2006 and 2015 …The findings of this report are attributable entirely to drug price growth among brand name and specialty drugs, which more than offset often substantial price decreases among generic drugs. If these trends continue, older Americans—particularly those on fixed incomes—will be unable to afford the prescription drugs that they need, leading to poorer health outcomes and higher health care costs in the future.” Walecia Konrad, June 26, 2017: “As PBMs negotiate more discounts and rebates, pharmaceutical companies have been raising prices at a record rate, in part to preserve the industry’s high profit margins.” Robert Langreth, Michael Keller and Christopher Cannon, June 29, 2016: “’List price increases “are accelerating across the board,’ said Jim Yocum, senior vice president for Connecture. His analysis found that brand drug list prices, on average, rose 11.5 percent a year since 2012. ‘Rebates can’t keep up.’”""One of Barclay Berdan’s prescriptions for a great workplace culture in the healthcare industry sounds a lot like “an apple a day.” Berdan is CEO of Texas Health Resources, which has ranked as the no.1 best workplace in healthcare for four straight years. And when you ask him the secret to success at the 25,000-person health system, he points to a practice that seems too simple to be effective: a newsletter that has been going out monthly to all employees for 15 years. Texas Health’s Promise Packet is a memo with two or three discussion items. These cover changes in the organization and include reminders of Texas Health’s purpose and values. No big deal, right? Wrong. The real value of the Promise Packet is that every team throughout the organization is expected to spend 15-20 minutes discussing the Packet items. Division and team leaders are given additional materials to help them guide the conversation. And those leaders are held accountable for holding the discussions. “We actually ask, ‘Did you do this?’ ” Berdan says. In effect, the Packet gets everyone on the same page and reflecting regularly on the Texas Health mission and values of respect, integrity, compassion, and excellence. Just like “an apple a day” often comes with wiser choices about diet and lifestyle, the Promise Packet is more than just a monthly newsletter. It has sparked healthy organizational behaviors, including a deeper sense of the Texas Health “promise” of “Individuals Caring For Individuals, Together.” “It’s not simply the newsletter itself that drives our strong culture. We use the Promise Packet as a catalyst for dialogue between employees, and that’s what makes all the difference,” Berdan says. “That ties everything together.” Values are Vital A strong purpose and a set of lived-out values are key features of the Best Workplaces in Healthcare & Biopharma. My organization, Great Place to Work, just published this year’s list of these top workplaces in partnership with Fortune. At Texas Health Resources and the rest of the list winners, 88% of employees say their work isn’t “just a job,” but has special meaning. And nearly 9 in 10 employees at these companies describe their leaders as honest and ethical in their business practices. Saving lives and otherwise improving the wellbeing of people makes it relatively easy for organizations in the healthcare field to rally employees around a mission. And our research finds that doing so is important if these businesses want to be agile amid all the changes affecting the industry. Challenges in the field range from an uncertain regulatory climate to the rise of evidence-based, personalized medicine and higher expectations from consumers concerning holistic care and information transparency. In studying 95,000 healthcare employees, we discovered that pride—a close cousin of purpose—is the strongest driver of organizational agility. When healthcare staffers are proud of their workplace, they are nine times more likely to say their coworkers are adaptable to changes. Clarity of purpose from executives also matters. Employees who say their leaders have a clear view of where the organization is going are five times more likely to say their peers are adaptable. Strong values put into practice by those at the top also figure in. When leaders are perceived as honest and ethical, employees are five times more likely to report an agile workforce around them. Pride and leaders living out values also fuel high levels of service. Our research discovered that when employees are proud of their organization, they are five times more likely to describe their organization’s service quality as high. And when leaders are considered honest, staffers are three times more likely to characterize the organization’s service as high-quality. Values and a Great Place to Work For All Values are one of the six components of what we call a Great Place to Work For All. In our new book of the same name, my coauthors and I explain how values, a foundation of trust, and effective leadership allow organizations of all industries to maximize their human potential, which leads to greater innovation and revenue growth. This formula has been at play at Horizon Pharma, another of the 2018 Best Workplaces in Healthcare and Biopharma. The Dublin, Ireland-based pharmaceutical firm with U.S. operations in the Chicago area opened its doors a decade ago. Already, it has seen revenues pass $1 billion, with medicines primarily for rare and rheumatic diseases. Purpose at Horizon begins with company founder Tim Walbert, who suffers from several autoimmune diseases himself and speaks of the company’s mission being “personal.” The nearly 1,000-person company makes this principle practical by bringing actual patients of its therapies to speak to employees at least once a quarter. Recently, a young girl who suffers from a rare disease called urea cycle disorder visited Horizon’s offices. The girl, who experienced a stroke and then subsequent brain damage from the disease and now takes a Horizon medicine to stabilize the condition, spoke about how happy she was that country singer Chris Jacobs wrote a song for her. Jacobs did so through a non-profit, Sing Me a Story, that Horizon supports. Hearing from this patient moved the entire staff, says Irina Konstantinovsky, chief human resources officer for the company. “Most of us had tears in our heart or in our eyes,” Konstantinovsky recalls. The “It’s Personal” philosophy extends to how Horizon leaders treat employees at all levels. Konstantinovsky recalls a meeting last year at which Walbert seemed distracted on his phone. It turned out he was texting with Horizon sales representatives in the Houston area, which was wrestling with severe flooding. “He wanted to know if they were okay,” Konstantinovsky says. “He wanted to know if he could help.” Tethered to a Great Culture At Texas Health Resources, a strong sense of purpose has meant shaking up the leadership ranks. Berdan took the reins of the organization in 2014. At that time, clinical professionals made up just 5 percent or so of the leadership teams at Texas Health. The number has risen to about 50%, because Berdan recognized that people like himself with MBAs, but without medical training, shouldn’t dominate if the goal is improved care. “You don’t want me deciding clinical practices,” Berdan says. “You want a physician, and a nurse, and a pharmacist.” Indeed, Berdan links this shift in mindset and leadership makeup to better results in patient safety, clinical outcomes, and clinical efficiency. One sign: Texas Health has received the QUEST Award for High-Value Healthcare from industry research group Premier for three straight years. That award covers topics including affordability, effective care, and patient safety. Texas Health’s executive changes and subsequent awards show how a focus on mission and values is better all around—better for the business and better for the people touched by the organization. If the Promise Packet is akin to the proverbial apple-a-day, Texas Health’s set of values is like a rock climber’s safety rope. It protects people as the organization adapts and innovates, Berdan says. “It’s sort of like a tether,” he says. “’I’m willing to take the risk of change, but I’m tethered to the values of the organization.’” Ed Frauenheim is director of research and content at Great Place to Work, Fortune’s longtime research partner for Best Workplace lists, including the Best Workplaces in Health Care & Biopharma.

This year, IDF will have the retreats, which are small regional conferences, in two great locations: Cleveland, Ohio on July 20 – 22 and in St. Augustine, Florida on August 10 – 12. Each retreat will feature special sessions for the Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) community. From patients and parents to siblings and partners, IDF has designed the retreats for everyone who is interested in developing better approaches to living with primary immunodeficiency (PI). It’s a great opportunity to connect with others going through similar experiences and have some fun. And the Special CGD Sessions will focus on topics related to living with this rare disorder. Perhaps, most importantly, the retreats create a time for people living with PI—no matter the specific diagnosis—to get together with others who are experiencing similar situations. Elisha Gonzalez, whose son, Kal, underwent a successful stem cell transplant in 2014 to treat CGD agrees wholeheartedly. “I love learning new things at the different symposiums, getting the latest research, and seeing how far the IDF community has come since we first got involved several years ago,” said Elisha, who attended an IDF Retreat in Salt Lake City in 2016. “Also, my favorite part is getting to meet real people who have gone through similar issues that we’ve gone through.” Also, given the closeness of the CGD community, Elisha added that being at an IDF Retreat is like being with family. And whether you’re newly diagnosed, have had CGD for many years, or have undergone curative treatment, as in her son’s case, you’re always welcome. “Although we aren’t dealing with the daily challenges of CGD anymore, I was so grateful to feel included,” said Elisha. “Also, in the CGD breakout meeting, I was able to speak to newly diagnosed families and give them an idea of what they could expect in the future, as well as answer their questions about our transplant journey. I was glad to feel valued for my experience.” Elisha said she’s still in touch with some of the families she met who were newly diagnosed at the time. It’s been wonderful to share information and feel connected. To top it off, she adds, her son and daughter, Kayelee, had a great time too! “The IDF does a wonderful job planning retreats for the whole family, from informative programs for adults, to creative activities and childcare for the kids,” said Elisha. “It was definitely a lot of fun and, as stay-at-home mom, I especially appreciated the opportunity to get away for a little bit too!” Elisha has shared her story her family’s experience on the IDF Reel Stories page and with Horizon Pharma’s CGD Connections. Click the image above to see Elisha and her family participate in an IDF Reel Story. Click the image above to see Elisha and Kal participate in Horizon Pharma’s CGD Connections video. Whether a person is newly diagnosed or has been living with PI for years, IDF Retreats offer an opportunity for individuals and family members to connect with others to learn more about dealing with their diseases. The educational sessions feature leading physicians and healthcare professionals who address the treatment and management of primary immunodeficiency.

And that’s because the company liked what it saw after tweaking its sales pitch.""Sudden and exorbitant drug price increases in recent years have brought the annual cost of treatment for some patients to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and have forced others to go without, sparking outrage throughout the United States. Price increases involving critical, life-saving drugs like EpiPen® and Daraprim® have been labeled “outrageous”, “predatory”, and “price gouging” events that solely drive drug company profits. The example of Daraprim®, a medication that had been available for 63 years yet had a 5,000% price increase in a single day, was so shocking it sparked a U.S. Senate special investigation and report. While drug price spikes involving prescriptions used in the group health setting have been widely covered in the press, unfortunately, the same pricing trend has occurred with several drugs used in the pain management setting for Workers’ Compensation injuries. The following chart contains three such examples: Vimovo®: This brand-name combination NSAID/PPI was historically manufactured by AstraZeneca for approximately $2/capsule. However, in January 2014 the rights to manufacture Vimovo® were sold to Horizon Pharma, which increased the cost, overnight, to $16/capsule (a 700% price increase). Horizon has since increased the cost of Vimovo® on a regular basis with a current, exorbitant price of $2,710.90 ($45.18/capsule). Pennsaid®: The price of this is topically applied NSAID was increased by 480% in one day in January 2015 by Horizon Pharma. Since that time the cost has risen even further to an excessive $2,716.02 per prescription. Levorphanol: This “generic” opioid has only one manufacturer, Sentynl Therapeutics. Given they are the sole generic manufacturer of levorphanol, they have increased the cost by an astronomical 2,959% since 2011, currently charging nearly $50 per tablet. If, in this financially turbulent pharmaceutical environment, you find patients on inordinately high-priced mediations such as Vimovo®, Pennsaid®, or levorphanol, often the prescriber is not aware of the exorbitant cost of these products and/or the safe, effective treatment options available. While primary consideration should always be clinical efficacy, having an open, transparent discussion with the prescribing provider about these unfortunate realities can only be of benefit to all parties with a vested interest in the outcome of care.

The week-long learning experience provided 125 young girls in grades 3-8 with opportunities to learn more about careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) through challenging and fun hands-on activities. Campers took part in a wide range of activities throughout the week that used engineering and design principles to solve different challenges. At the beginning of the week, the campers built their own percussion, wind and string instruments while learning about sound engineering. They also had the opportunity to learn about biomechanical engineering and experiment with joint structure and function by building their own prosthetic arm. “I loved the cool and different experiments we did every day,” said Leilani San Nicolas, a seventh-grade STEMgirls camper. “The experiments are not things you can just buy in a science kit at the store.” A group of campers visited Medline Industries Inc.in Mundelein, Illinois where they toured a real lab environment while learning the ins and outs of mechanical testing. The last day of camp was an opportunity for parents to hear from industry professionals and learn how they can help support their daughters’ future careers in STEM. “Since my daughter has participated in STEMgirls, she has been more inquisitive about things in the world. She questions why, how or what if, and she performs research and experiments on her own to find the answer,” said Leilani’s mother, Annette San Nicolas.“We have more discussions about STEM-related topics than we do about hair and makeup. We share a lot of our knowledge with each other and I learn a lot from her.” STEMgirls is made possible through the support of iBIO members Abbott, AbbVie, the Astellas USA Foundation, Horizon Pharma and the VWR Foundation. “This incredible week of learning and development for young girls interested in STEM wouldn’t be possible without the generous support fromour donors,” said Ann Vogel, senior vice president of the iBIO Institute EDUCATE Center. “Their recognition of the growing need for STEM education early-on provides these young girls with an enriching experience that leads to opportunities they otherwise might not have access to.” To learn more about STEMgirls and other programs the iBIO Institute EDUCATE Center offers, click here.

These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal. ORLANDO — Gout may be an ancient disease, with arthritis of the big toe having been described in Egypt in 2,600 BC, but only now are the underlying pathophysiologic events being elucidated and understood. Current thinking on the pathogenesis of gout, which today affects more than 8 million Americans — 4% of the population — has evolved into the “mobilization flare” hypothesis. In this disease conceptualization, when serum urate levels exceed 6 mg/dL, even in asymptomatic individuals, deposition of urate crystals in the synovium and other tissues begins. “Gout represents the most hyperinflamed situation we know about,” said Peter Lipsky, MD, from Charlottesville, Virginia, at the Florida Society of Rheumatology annual meeting. Crystals of monosodium urate form in close proximity to each other and proteins and rapidly become an insoluble crystalline lattice structure, explained Lipsky, the former scientific director of NIH National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland. The surface of that structure is quite active and is in equilibrium with uric acid levels in surrounding tissues. But with sudden changes in the microenvironment, which could be the level of uric acid, pH, temperature, or changes in proteins that increase their solubility, the lattice matrix becomes unstable and crystals begin to shed off the surface into the surrounding tissue, he noted. “If the shedding is relatively modest, with only a few crystals being released, those can be opsonized with a variety of positively charged proteins including ApoE and they do not become inflammatory,” he said. However, if a large mass of crystals is shed, the crystals can begin to interact with receptors on immune cells, the process of inflammation begins, and if the crystals are opsonized with immunoglobulin, the process is further heightened. “It’s a very dynamic process occurring at the surface of this crystalline lattice structure, and it’s the additional proteins in the environment that seem to control whether or not the crystals are shed,” he noted. Further understanding of the underlying processing leading to gout derived from work initially done at the NIH among children with autoinflammatory diseases, in which a cellular structure known as the inflammasome was described, according to Lipsky. The NLRP3 inflammasome is capable of sensing the presence of a variety of intracellular molecules and can lead to the induction of inflammatory responses. When the molecule is the monosodium urate crystal and not soluble monosodium urate, the multiprotein structure assembles and releases activated caspase-1, which is the critical enzyme involved in the processing of interleukins (IL) 1 and 18 and other proinflammatory molecules. This leads to the production and release from the cell of active IL-1 and IL-18 — and the inflammatory response. “This is the basis of how we now understand that urate crystals stimulate inflammation, and is also the basis of why the IL-1 blocker canakinumab [Ilaris] seems to be so effective in controlling inflammation in gout,” he concluded. Lipsky disclosed a relevant relationships with Horizon Pharma. 2018-07-15T11:00:00-0400 Source link The post New Insights into how Gout Happens appeared first on health.10ztalk.com.""February 15, 2018 7:12 am by David Crow in New York An Irish drugmaker has put a price tag of almost $3,000 on a bottle of two-in-one painkillers that can be bought separately for $36, in another instance of gouging in the US, the world’s largest healthcare market. Horizon Pharma has continually raised the price of Vimovo, a common painkiller combined with a drug that prevents stomach irritation, since it acquired the US rights to the medicine in November 2013 from AstraZeneca. The Dublin-based company raised the average wholesale price again earlier this month by 9.9 per cent, according to data seen by the Financial Times, taking the cost of a bottle of 60 pills to $2,979. When AstraZeneca was selling the drug in the US, the price was $138 per bottle. But since Horizon has owned the rights, it has raised the price on 11 occasions by an aggregate of more than 2,000 per cent. AstraZeneca still has the rights to Vimovo outside the US and sells exactly the same medicine in Europe for a weighted average price of roughly 35 cents a pill, according to a company spokesperson. That means 60 tablets would cost around $21 — about 140 times cheaper than the Horizon product. Soaring drug costs have been at the forefront of public debate in the US ever since Martin Shkreli, the biotech entrepreneur, raised the price of a cancer and Aids medicine by 5,000 per cent. US President Donald Trump addressed the issue in his State of the Union address last month, saying the administration would “make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities” and pledging “prices will come down”. Vimovo is a mixture of two medicines: naproxen, an anti-inflammatory that treats pain but can also cause gastrointestinal problems such as ulcers and bleeding; and esomeprazole, a medicine known as a proton-pump inhibitor, which lessens the risk of stomach problems. If purchased individually, the drugs can cost as little as $36 and both are available in over-the-counter forms: naproxen is sold under the brand name Aleve, made by Bayer, while AstraZeneca sells esomeprazole as Nexium. “Companies often try to come up with equations where one plus one equals three. In this case, it appears one plus one ends up costing 83 times more,” said Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, which makes software to help patients reduce their drug bills. He added: “It’s a painful experience for unsuspecting patients and insurers.” Horizon also markets another two-in-one painkiller, Duexis, which is a mixture of ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug, and famotidine, an antacid. A bottle of 90 tablets is priced at $2,979, while buying the pills separately can cost as little as $15. The company generated $134m in sales from both products in the first nine months of last year. “Based on the mechanism of action of these drugs, I see no reason why these products can’t be taken individually,” said Mr Rea. Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits manager that negotiates with drugmakers on behalf of its employer and health insurer clients, said it included Vimovo and Duexis on the list of medicines it will reimburse but that they did not have “preferred” status. To discourage people from picking more expensive “non-preferred” medicines, Express Scripts clients can ask patients to pay out of their own pocket. But like other pharma groups Horizon tries to counter this by offering patients a savings card that can reduce their personal outlay to zero while continuing to bill the insurer for their full share. Express Scripts said: “The constituent parts of these medications are available separately as generics for much less.” It added that some of the PBM’s clients require patients try the individual drugs first before they will reimburse Horizon’s two-in-one medicines. Horizon said this practice, known as “step therapy”, was in “direct conflict” with prescribing information from the US Food and Drug Administration, which says patients should not substitute the combination pills for individual tablets. A company spokesperson added: “There are no FDA-approved generic, over-the-counter or clinically equivalent medicines to Duexis and Vimovo, and any assertion otherwise is completely inaccurate.” He also said Horizon operated patient assistance programmes that meant the majority of people pay less than $10 out of their own pocket. However, patients still end up paying more for expensive drugs such as Vimovo and Duexis in the form of higher insurance premiums.""Irish drugmaker Horizon Pharma raises painkiller price to $3,000 in US""Marijuana It is one of the most common illegitimate drugs costing around ?3.6m per kg.

The drug is 22 times more expensive than when the company acquired it in late 2013. The sticker shock for Horizon Pharma’s Vimovo drug is magnified by the fact that the painkiller’s two main ingredients can be purchased separately — for just $36. Although patients typically pay just a fraction of the price for Vimovo, the dramatic price increase underlines what critics describe as a murky and wasteful system that ultimately leads to higher health care costs for all Americans. A spokesman for Dublin-based Horizon said that the $2,979 price does not reflect “the cost to patients or the cost to the system.” The company said it has programs to ensure that commercially-insured patients have access “at an affordable price” — even if the patient’s insurance refuses to cover the cost. Horizon estimates that 98% of all insured Vimovo patients pay $10 or less out of pocket. The drug industry has come under increasing pressure from a series of scandals in recent years, including extreme price hikes on an AIDS drug by “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli and on lifesaving allergy treatment EpiPen by Mylan. President Trump has repeatedly vowed to bring drug prices down.

You’re in good company given that it impacts over eight million Americans, making it the most common form of inflammatory arthritis. Despite it being common, no one should have to live with gout because, today, we understand what causes it and how to treat it. Yet, despite these advances, many suffer from flares and live with avoidable pain in their joints. Gout is not just diet driven It’s true that diet is a factor in gout, and the public often thinks it’s the only important factor. It’s true that being overweight raises the blood uric acid level (which we call sUA or urate). It’s also true that when we eat protein, one of the products of its breakdown is urate. Foods that have been associated with gout flares include alcohol of all types (with beer possibly being the worst), red meat, high fructose corn syrup (as in regularly-sweetened sodas), shellfish and organ meats such as liver. However, although diet is important in gout, the real cause lies in urate itself and in a person’s genetic tendency to gout. Urate is the key to understanding gout. When there is too much uric acid, crystals can form and settle in multiple places in the body, especially the joints. High blood urate levels, called hyperuricemia, precede a person’s first gout flare. Many people are naturally disposed to developing hyperuricemia on a genetic basis. People without a hereditary tendency to gout don’t get gout flares even if they eat or drink all the “wrong things.” Other factors can cause or set off gout beyond genetics and diet. Abnormal kidney function can raise urate levels. Taking diuretics can likewise raise urate levels. Gout is also complicated by the fact that it is almost always (over 90%) accompanied by at least one other of a group of medical problems, including obesity, heart disease, high cholesterol/triglycerides, diabetes and kidney disease. With this in mind, rheumatologists treating gout consider both lifestyle changes, diet, and medication therapy, all of which contribute to getting urate levels below the goal of less than 6.0. If a patient can keep urate levels below 6.0, over time gout flares almost always stop happening. Diet and weight loss are usually not enough, and most people need medication. Patience and persistence with therapy are needed! Gout is Out of Control As was made clear in a survey of 1,000 gout patients and 500 caregivers conducted by the non-profit arthritis advocacy group CreakyJoints®, gout is a disease that is out of control. Patients surveyed experienced an average of eight painful gout attacks per year and more than fifty percent reported their attacks lasted three or more days.[ii] Half of all patients did not report symptoms they experienced to their doctor and nearly one third hid attacks from loved ones. Having two or more gout attacks per year means that it’s time for a treatment change. Flares can cause patients to have difficulty walking, climbing stairs or sleeping. And a person can develop significant functional disability. [iii] Caregivers are impacted as well. Of those surveyed, on average, they missed 4.5 days of work to care for their loved one during a flare and the vast majority worry about gout’s impact on their loved one’s physical and emotional health. Certainly, intimacy is impacted when your partner is having pain. Get Educated About Gout Rheumatologists, primary care providers, nurses and other healthcare professionals have an important role to play in educating people with gout and their loved ones about its causes and management. It starts with setting a target of lowering uric acid levels (sUA) to below 6mg/dl. That’s why it’s important to have the urate level tested in anyone suspected of having gout. Levels should be also it followed over time to make sure it’s kept below 6. Since most people with gout need medication to control urate level, the most important part of their treatment is to stay regularly on the medication and to follow up with their doctor to have the urate levels checked over time. In addition, people with gout can help reduce flares by: Staying hydrated and avoiding regularly-sweetened drinks (which are likely to have high-fructose corn syrup) Working towards or maintaining a healthy weight. Losing weight decreases can lower urate levels (but usually not enough to avoid medication) Limiting red meat, shellfish and organ meats such as liver Reducing alcohol intake (or avoiding it entirely). Men who drink beer seem to be at higher risk for gout symptoms, but all types of alcohol raise urate levels.[iv] CreakyJoints recently published “Raising the Voice of Patients: The Patient’s Guide to Treating and Managing Gout.” Using easy-to-understand language, these guidelines provide comprehensive education for people living with gout. It’s a resource a family might consult in between appointments so that they know what questions to ask their doctor during the next visit. Written by patients and CreakyJoints staff and medically reviewed by rheumatologists (including myself), the patient guidelines provide an unbiased review of different management strategies, including the different medications, complementary therapies, and alternative therapies. It also suggests approaches to speaking with insurance companies and working with the larger arthritis community to advocate for patient-centered health policy and laws. When a doctor and a person with gout work closely together, it is entirely possible to keep gout under control. Asking for support is vital. I advise my patients to talk openly about their disease with their family, friends, and employers so that those around them can help when there is a need. Online support is also available at CreakyJoints. Gout flares are not something a person needs to tolerate or expect from their diagnosis. It can often take a year or longer to get gout flares to stop, even with a perfect regimen of gout treatment. However, over the long run, a successful outcome is almost always reached. And a much better quality of life can be achieved. About the gout survey and patient guidelines The gout survey was conducted online among 1,000 gout patients and 500 caregivers of gout patients in March 2017 to gain insight into their perceptions of and experiences with gout. Edelman Intelligence conducted the survey, which was made possible by CreakyJoints, with funding from Ironwood Pharmaceuticals. “Raising the Voice of Patients: The Patient’s Guide to Treating and Managing Gout, is available for free at www.CreakyJoints.org/patientguidelines (among other volumes covering other forms of arthritis) and they were jointly sponsored by Horizon Pharma and Ironwood Pharmaceuticals.

You have the back story for this drug since you were in the trenches and, as interesting as your story is, its missing the full story for me. ibuprofen can be bought over the counter, right? famotidine can be bought over the counter, yes? Does Horizon Pharma have a lock or patent on manufacturing this two chemicals in one pill? Cant someone else just pack one 800 mg pill of ibuprofen and 1 26.6 mg of famotidine inside each blister of a blister pack? What do you want to know in regards to the full story? Horizon charges want it thinks it can get for widely available generic meds combined into 1 pill. Of course the two pill pack would work, but Id imagine youd have to go through all the extended trials and spend hundreds of millions of dollars in test fees to the FDA to make it happen. Or you could sell it from the trunk of your car or something. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Be unpredictable at times.

As I said before, I was a rep for Horizon Pharma (schmoozing doctors and flirting with nurses) and sold Duexis/Vimovo/Pennsaid 2%. Duexis is for the treatment of Osteo Arthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis and Ankylosing Spondylosis. Duexis is 800mg of pharmaceutical grade ibuprofen and 26.6mg of famotidine. The ibuprofen is anti-inflammatory/pain relief, the famotidine (Pepcid) is for gastro protection. This medication is to be taken 3 times per day. The reason for the famotidine is for gastro-protection. If youre taking large amounts of ibuprofen to treat a chronic condition, you will eventually get a gastric bleed. By the time you realize you have a gastric bleed, its usually pretty far along. This is a fantastic product. Its actually the most commonly stolen item in offices, other than Viagra. Duexis actually works very well for what its meant to do. Its also an amazing hangover cure! Yes, the two components of Duexis are cheaply available at your local drug store. Probably about $20 for a month supply. (My come back when the doctor would say this is that 1 pill is easier to take than two pills, then Id pull out a study showing how people tend not to take that second pill after a while. While winking, Id then ask the doctor if hed be certain that his patients would always remember to take that all important second pill, on top of the 40 other pills theyre already prescribed because ""Doc, this is ultimately for patient safety...gastric bleeds are gross dude!"" (Id say it in a more professional manner). After visiting the same doctor 3 times per week and saying the same thing (While plying the office with coffee and delicious pastries and tons of samples), maybe eventually hed start prescribing my med, or get pissed off and tell me to never come back again. Id still go back either way Yes, each pill costs about $30...you gotta take 3 per day usually for the rest of your life. The pricing is set by the company and is based on nothing more than them taking advantage of insurance companies to the tune of about $3,000 per month per patient prescribed. To actually have your insurance pay for this, you need to be a special person. You have to have solid commercial insurance (no Medicaid, medicare, or Tricare). The most important part is that you have the doctors office call it in to a SPECIALTY PHARMACY...they will handle your pissed off insurance company and mail you the medication within a day. CVS, Walgreens etc will charge you $3000 and tell you to not be an idiot while sending you to get famotidine and some ibu for $20. The pricing for this medication is everything thats wrong with the pharmaceutical industry and Im genuinely surprised that Horizon Pharma is still in business. The docs who would prescribe it either didnt know about the pricing, didnt care, or prescribe in the genuine best interest of their patient, prices be damned (most common). ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Be unpredictable at times. Only boring, dull-witted people never stray from the path. - Para Totus Tuus""As nurses, its usually easy to explain why we chose this career: for most of us, we just want to help people. While we often focus on the patients themselves, our work can have a lasting impact on the patients families, as well. This National Nurses Week, as I reflect on my career path and the lessons Ive learned along the way, I want all nurses to recognize and remember how helping just one patient can make a significant difference in their lives beyond the care setting. Ive worked in healthcare for over 15 years, including a few years as an ER nurse. While my colleagues loved the excitement of not knowing what each day could bring, and the opportunities to help a variety of patients, I began to crave more intimate interactions with patients. I love teaching people about their health, so I started to explore jobs that would allow me to flex that skill. A colleague of mine was working as a Clinical Nurse Educator (CNE), helping to teach people with autoimmune diseases about their care and treatment. She invited me to join her for a project, and Ive never looked back. I now work as a CNE for Horizon Pharma, a biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing the unmet needs of patients, including those with rare genetic diseases. In my role, I work as part of a support program for people living with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), one of the 350+ types of primary immunodeficiencies. With CGD, the immune system does not work as it should, leading to repeated, severe infections. My primary responsibility is to help CGD patients, as well as their families, understand and manage their disease and the treatment plan that their healthcare provider has set for them. Because only 20 children are born with CGD each year in the United States - and its one of a whole category of similar diseases - the disease can be difficult for even the most experienced doctors to identify. By the time patients are correctly diagnosed, they and their families are often frustrated, exhausted and scared. And because these patient populations are so small, it can be difficult to find people who understand what they are going through. Thats why its so impactful when Im able to work with a new patient. I jump in and work closely with the patient and his/her family to teach them about CGD and to help them understand their medication, as well as other factors relating to their disease. While many general healthcare providers are not familiar with CGD, this condition is my sole focus; I am able to provide more in-depth knowledge of what daily life looks like managing this disease, as well as additional support and resources. Serving as an advocate for these families who will listen to their fears and concerns is a crucial, and very rewarding part of my role. Because I stay with these patients for as long as they are on their medication, I get to watch them grow, often from uncertain newcomers to passionate champions for their new community. Ill never forget one family who I witnessed go through this transformation. When their young boys were diagnosed and prescribed a treatment plan, I reached out to introduce myself and schedule a visit - but it quickly became clear they were weary and tired of the clinical talk. I understood, and let them know Id be there for them if they ever had questions or needed help. About a month later, the parents contacted me, asking for help. Im so happy I was able to show how I could help them. We now regularly keep in touch, and I love watching their boys grow. I work each day to support these 60+ patients-a miniscule group compared to the number of people who come through the ER each year. Yet I dont feel like Im making any less of an impact than I was during my time in the traditional clinical setting; through the personal relationships I have formed with my CGD patients, I can see the positive impact I have on their daily lives, beyond their treatment plan. For this small, often isolated community, I am a dedicated voice for their unique needs, and ultimately help them to live empowered with the disease. After I became a CNE, I came to appreciate how just one ""win"" with a patient each day can make a lasting difference in their lives. This National Nurses Week, I hope all nurses recognize, no matter how many patients they treat or how big the community they support, there is an immeasurable effect they can have on their patients.""anonymous said: ? HAHAHA. Joke of the week. You need to look up the definition of Integrity because it certainly does not apply to horizon. Click to expand... I think someone was being sarcastic""Shes with Horizon Pharma. I used to be with them too, but my territory was shitty (Philly) and got absorbed into another territory. Horizon Pharma is known for its obscene bonus structure for reps. I wouldnt suggest working for them though. If you have a week territory, youre removed quick. Its also selling ibuprofen that goes for $3000 a month for your insurance company. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Totus Tuus""anonymous said: ? Who voted against the ridiculously high buyout offer from Horizon Pharma? Was Smith on the board of Depomed and voted against it? Those are the fat cats responsible for screwing this company. Click to expand... Haha starboard definitely didnt vote against the Horizon offer. Starboard got pissed off because we turned down the Starboard offer.""anonymous said: ? Seems, you are right...Thank You jeff Smith from Starboard for this desaster... Click to expand... Who voted against the ridiculously high buyout offer from Horizon Pharma? Was Smith on the board of Depomed and voted against it? Those are the fat cats responsible for screwing this company.""I can see both sides of this. The company thats spending the money on this project basically wants to patent this drug in whatever brand name they come up with so they can cash in on it much like Horizon Pharma patented the combination of Ibuprofen and Pepcid under the brand name Duexis and you can buy all the active ingredients otc. Now youre right, on its own the SNRI effects of tramadol are desirable especially in the case of nerve pain or fibromyalgia since PM doctors dealing with those conditions are fans of SNRI and tricyclic antidepressants since theyve been shown to be effective for those conditions in those who can tolerate them. However like someone else mentioned tramadol cannot be taken alongside other antidepressants and certain other meds and chemicals and while there are other opioids that are about the same strength, that doesnt mean they are necessarily well tolerated in said individual. For example, some people are allergic to codeine so they cant use it. On another note out of curiosity are you against o-dsmt becoming a pharmaceutical because you think its a rather pointless endeavor? Or are you someone of the anti opioid mindset?""I worked for this shit company years ago. Was part of the Rheumatology group. Was probably the worse job I held in my Pharma job. They all joked who they would fire next! I would see reps put on PIPs after a few months. Managers quit after a few months. What a horrible culture it was at Horizon. So many reps were stressed every day, every hour. Management Sucked!!"']
